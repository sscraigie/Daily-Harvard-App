     <p>“’T was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs</p>
     <p>Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,</p>
     <p>When Hector’s ghost before my sight appears:</p>
     <p>A bloody shroud he seem’d, and bath’d in tears;</p>
     <p>Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,</p>
     <p>Thessalian coursers dragg’d him o’er the plain.</p>
     <p>Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust</p>
     <p>Thro’ the bor’d holes; his body black with dust;</p>
     <p>Unlike that Hector who return’d from toils</p>
     <p>Of war, triumphant, in Æacian spoils,</p>
     <p>Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,</p>
     <p>And launch’d against their navy Phrygian fire.</p>
     <p>His hair and beard stood stiffen’d with his gore;</p>
     <p>And all the wounds he for his country bore</p>
     <p>Now stream’d afresh, and with new purple ran.</p>
     <p>I wept to see the visionary man,</p>
     <p>And, while my trance continued, thus began:</p>
     <p>‘O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,</p>
     <p>Thy father’s champion, and thy country’s joy!</p>
     <p>O, long expected by thy friends! from whence</p>
     <p>Art thou so late return’d for our defense?</p>
     <p>Do we behold thee, wearied as we are</p>
     <p>With length of labors, and with toils of war?</p>
     <p>After so many fun’rals of thy own</p>
     <p>Art thou restor’d to thy declining town?</p>
     <p>But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace</p>
     <p>Deforms the manly features of thy face?’</p>
     <p>“To this the specter no reply did frame,</p>
     <p>But answer’d to the cause for which he came,</p>
     <p>And, groaning from the bottom of his breast,</p>
     <p>This warning in these mournful words express’d:</p>
     <p>‘O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight,</p>
     <p>The flames and horrors of this fatal night.</p>
     <p>The foes already have possess’d the wall;</p>
     <p>Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.</p>
     <p>Enough is paid to Priam’s royal name,</p>
     <p>More than enough to duty and to fame.</p>
     <p>If by a mortal hand my father’s throne</p>
     <p>Could be defended, ’t was by mine alone.</p>
     <p>Now Troy to thee commends her future state,</p>
     <p>And gives her gods companions of thy fate:</p>
     <p>From their assistance happier walls expect,</p>
     <p>Which, wand’ring long, at last thou shalt erect.’</p>
     <p>He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes,</p>
     <p>The venerable statues of the gods,</p>
     <p>With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,</p>
     <p>The wreaths and relics of th’ immortal fire.</p>
     <p>“Now peals of shouts come thund’ring from afar,</p>
     <p>Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:</p>
     <p>The noise approaches, tho’ our palace stood</p>
     <p>Aloof from streets, encompass’d with a wood.</p>
     <p>Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th’ alarms</p>
     <p>Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.</p>
     <p>Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,</p>
     <p>But mount the terrace, thence the town survey,</p>
     <p>And hearken what the frightful sounds convey.</p>
     <p>Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,</p>
     <p>Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;</p>
     <p>Or deluges, descending on the plains,</p>
     <p>Sweep o’er the yellow year, destroy the pains</p>
     <p>Of lab’ring oxen and the peasant’s gains;</p>
     <p>Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away</p>
     <p>Flocks, folds, and trees, an undistinguish’d prey:</p>
     <p>The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far</p>
     <p>The wasteful ravage of the wat’ry war.</p>
     <p>Then Hector’s faith was manifestly clear’d,</p>
     <p>And Grecian frauds in open light appear’d.</p>
     <p>The palace of Deiphobus ascends</p>
     <p>In smoky flames, and catches on his friends.</p>
     <p>Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright</p>
     <p>With splendor not their own, and shine with Trojan light.</p>
     <p>New clamors and new clangors now arise,</p>
     <p>The sound of trumpets mix’d with fighting cries.</p>
     <p>With frenzy seiz’d, I run to meet th’ alarms,</p>
     <p>Resolv’d on death, resolv’d to die in arms,</p>
     <p>But first to gather friends, with them t’ oppose</p>
     <p>(If fortune favor’d) and repel the foes;</p>
     <p>Spurr’d by my courage, by my country fir’d,</p>
     <p>With sense of honor and revenge inspir’d.</p>
     <p>“Pantheus, Apollo’s priest, a sacred name,</p>
     <p>Had scap’d the Grecian swords, and pass’d the flame:</p>
     <p>With relics loaden, to my doors he fled,</p>
     <p>And by the hand his tender grandson led.</p>
     <p>‘What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run?</p>
     <p>Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?’</p>
     <p>Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan:</p>
     <p>‘Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!</p>
     <p>The fatal day, th’ appointed hour, is come,</p>
     <p>When wrathful Jove’s irrevocable doom</p>
     <p>Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.</p>
     <p>The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;</p>
     <p>And armed hosts, an unexpected force,</p>
     <p>Break from the bowels of the fatal horse.</p>
     <p>Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about</p>
     <p>The flames; and foes for entrance press without,</p>
     <p>With thousand others, whom I fear to name,</p>
     <p>More than from Argos or Mycenæ came.</p>
     <p>To sev’ral posts their parties they divide;</p>
     <p>Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:</p>
     <p>The bold they kill, th’ unwary they surprise;</p>
     <p>Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies.</p>
     <p>The warders of the gate but scarce maintain</p>
     <p>Th’ unequal combat, and resist in vain.’</p>
     <p>“I heard; and Heav’n, that well-born souls inspires,</p>
     <p>Prompts me thro’ lifted swords and rising fires</p>
     <p>To run where clashing arms and clamor calls,</p>
     <p>And rush undaunted to defend the walls.</p>
     <p>Ripheus and Iph’itus by my side engage,</p>
     <p>For valor one renown’d, and one for age.</p>
     <p>Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew</p>
     <p>My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;</p>
     <p>With young Coroebus, who by love was led</p>
     <p>To win renown and fair Cassandra’s bed,</p>
     <p>And lately brought his troops to Priam’s aid,</p>
     <p>Forewarn’d in vain by the prophetic maid.</p>
     <p>Whom when I saw resolv’d in arms to fall,</p>
     <p>And that one spirit animated all:</p>
     <p>‘Brave souls!’ said I,—’but brave, alas! in vain—</p>
     <p>Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain.</p>
     <p>You see the desp’rate state of our affairs,</p>
     <p>And heav’n’s protecting pow’rs are deaf to pray’rs.</p>
     <p>The passive gods behold the Greeks defile</p>
     <p>Their temples, and abandon to the spoil</p>
     <p>Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire</p>
     <p>To save a sinking town, involv’d in fire.</p>
     <p>Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:</p>
     <p>Despair of life the means of living shows.’</p>
     <p>So bold a speech incourag’d their desire</p>
     <p>Of death, and added fuel to their fire.</p>
     <p>“As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,</p>
     <p>Scour thro’ the fields, nor fear the stormy night—</p>
     <p>Their whelps at home expect the promis’d food,</p>
     <p>And long to temper their dry chaps in blood—</p>
     <p>So rush’d we forth at once; resolv’d to die,</p>
     <p>Resolv’d, in death, the last extremes to try.</p>
     <p>We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare</p>
     <p>Th’ unequal combat in the public square:</p>
     <p>Night was our friend; our leader was despair.</p>
     <p>What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?</p>
     <p>What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?</p>
     <p>An ancient and imperial city falls:</p>
     <p>The streets are fill’d with frequent funerals;</p>
     <p>Houses and holy temples float in blood,</p>
     <p>And hostile nations make a common flood.</p>
     <p>Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,</p>
     <p>The vanquish’d triumph, and the victors mourn.</p>
     <p>Ours take new courage from despair and night:</p>
     <p>Confus’d the fortune is, confus’d the fight.</p>
     <p>All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears;</p>
     <p>And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears.</p>
     <p>Androgeos fell among us, with his band,</p>
     <p>Who thought us Grecians newly come to land.</p>
     <p>‘From whence,’ said he, ‘my friends, this long delay?</p>
     <p>You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:</p>
     <p>Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;</p>
     <p>And you, like truants, come too late ashore.’</p>
     <p>He said, but soon corrected his mistake,</p>
     <p>Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:</p>
     <p>Amaz’d, he would have shunn’d th’ unequal fight;</p>
     <p>But we, more num’rous, intercept his flight.</p>
     <p>As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,</p>
     <p>Has with unwary footing press’d a snake;</p>
     <p>He starts aside, astonish’d, when he spies</p>
     <p>His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;</p>
     <p>So from our arms surpris’d Androgeos flies.</p>
     <p>In vain; for him and his we compass’d round,</p>
     <p>Possess’d with fear, unknowing of the ground,</p>
     <p>And of their lives an easy conquest found.</p>
     <p>Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil’d.</p>
     <p>Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil’d,</p>
     <p>Swoln with success, and of a daring mind,</p>
     <p>This new invention fatally design’d.</p>
     <p>‘My friends,’ said he, ‘since Fortune shows the way,</p>
     <p>’T is fit we should th’ auspicious guide obey.</p>
     <p>For what has she these Grecian arms bestow’d,</p>
     <p>But their destruction, and the Trojans’ good?</p>
     <p>Then change we shields, and their devices bear:</p>
     <p>Let fraud supply the want of force in war.</p>
     <p>They find us arms.’ This said, himself he dress’d</p>
     <p>In dead Androgeos’ spoils, his upper vest,</p>
     <p>His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.</p>
     <p>Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,</p>
     <p>Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.</p>
     <p>Mix’d with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,</p>
     <p>Flatter’d with hopes to glut our greedy rage;</p>
     <p>Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,</p>
     <p>And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.</p>
     <p>Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,</p>
     <p>Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;</p>
     <p>And some, oppress’d with more ignoble fear,</p>
     <p>Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.</p>
     <p>“But, ah! what use of valor can be made,</p>
     <p>When heav’n’s propitious pow’rs refuse their aid!</p>
     <p>Behold the royal prophetess, the fair</p>
     <p>Cassandra, dragg’d by her dishevel’d hair,</p>
     <p>Whom not Minerva’s shrine, nor sacred bands,</p>
     <p>In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:</p>
     <p>On heav’n she cast her eyes, she sigh’d, she cried—</p>
     <p>’T was all she could—her tender arms were tied.</p>
     <p>So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear;</p>
     <p>But, fir’d with rage, distracted with despair,</p>
     <p>Amid the barb’rous ravishers he flew:</p>
     <p>Our leader’s rash example we pursue.</p>
     <p>But storms of stones, from the proud temple’s height,</p>
     <p>Pour down, and on our batter’d helms alight:</p>
     <p>We from our friends receiv’d this fatal blow,</p>
     <p>Who thought us Grecians, as we seem’d in show.</p>
     <p>They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;</p>
     <p>And ours beneath the pond’rous ruin lie.</p>
     <p>Then, mov’d with anger and disdain, to see</p>
     <p>Their troops dispers’d, the royal virgin free,</p>
     <p>The Grecians rally, and their pow’rs unite,</p>
     <p>With fury charge us, and renew the fight.</p>
     <p>The brother kings with Ajax join their force,</p>
     <p>And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.</p>
     <p>“Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,</p>
     <p>Contending for the kingdom of the sky,</p>
     <p>South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;</p>
     <p>The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:</p>
     <p>Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,</p>
     <p>And, mix’d with ooze and sand, pollute the skies.</p>
     <p>The troops we squander’d first again appear</p>
     <p>From several quarters, and enclose the rear.</p>
     <p>They first observe, and to the rest betray,</p>
     <p>Our diff’rent speech; our borrow’d arms survey.</p>
     <p>Oppress’d with odds, we fall; Coroebus first,</p>
     <p>At Pallas’ altar, by Peneleus pierc’d.</p>
     <p>Then Ripheus follow’d, in th’ unequal fight;</p>
     <p>Just of his word, observant of the right:</p>
     <p>Heav’n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,</p>
     <p>With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends.</p>
     <p>Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands</p>
     <p>Of awful Phoebus, sav’d from impious hands.</p>
     <p>Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,</p>
     <p>What I perform’d, and what I suffer’d there;</p>
     <p>No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,</p>
     <p>Expos’d to death, and prodigal of life;</p>
     <p>Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:</p>
     <p>I strove to have deserv’d the death I sought.</p>
     <p>But, when I could not fight, and would have died,</p>
     <p>Borne off to distance by the growing tide,</p>
     <p>Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence,</p>
     <p>With Pelias wounded, and without defense.</p>
     <p>New clamors from th’ invested palace ring:</p>
     <p>We run to die, or disengage the king.</p>
     <p>So hot th’ assault, so high the tumult rose,</p>
     <p>While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose</p>
     <p>As all the Dardan and Argolic race</p>
     <p>Had been contracted in that narrow space;</p>
     <p>Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,</p>
     <p>And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there.</p>
     <p>Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,</p>
     <p>Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:</p>
     <p>Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,</p>
     <p>Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;</p>
     <p>Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th’ ascent,</p>
     <p>While with their right they seize the battlement.</p>
     <p>From their demolish’d tow’rs the Trojans throw</p>
     <p>Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;</p>
     <p>And heavy beams and rafters from the sides</p>
     <p>(Such arms their last necessity provides)</p>
     <p>And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,</p>
     <p>The marks of state and ancient royalty.</p>
     <p>The guards below, fix’d in the pass, attend</p>
     <p>The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.</p>
     <p>Renew’d in courage with recover’d breath,</p>
     <p>A second time we ran to tempt our death,</p>
     <p>To clear the palace from the foe, succeed</p>
     <p>The weary living, and revenge the dead.</p>
     <p>“A postern door, yet unobserv’d and free,</p>
     <p>Join’d by the length of a blind gallery,</p>
     <p>To the king’s closet led: a way well known</p>
     <p>To Hector’s wife, while Priam held the throne,</p>
     <p>Thro’ which she brought Astyanax, unseen,</p>
     <p>To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire’s queen.</p>
     <p>Thro’ this we pass, and mount the tow’r, from whence</p>
     <p>With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense.</p>
     <p>From this the trembling king had oft descried</p>
     <p>The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.</p>
     <p>Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,</p>
     <p>Then, wrenching with our hands, th’ assault renew;</p>
     <p>And, where the rafters on the columns meet,</p>
     <p>We push them headlong with our arms and feet.</p>
     <p>The lightning flies not swifter than the fall,</p>
     <p>Nor thunder louder than the ruin’d wall:</p>
     <p>Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath</p>
     <p>Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death.</p>
     <p>Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent;</p>
     <p>We cease not from above, nor they below relent.</p>
     <p>Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat’ning loud,</p>
     <p>With glitt’ring arms conspicuous in the crowd.</p>
     <p>So shines, renew’d in youth, the crested snake,</p>
     <p>Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,</p>
     <p>And, casting off his slough when spring returns,</p>
     <p>Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;</p>
     <p>Restor’d with pois’nous herbs, his ardent sides</p>
     <p>Reflect the sun; and rais’d on spires he rides;</p>
     <p>High o’er the grass, hissing he rolls along,</p>
     <p>And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.</p>
     <p>Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,</p>
     <p>His father’s charioteer, together run</p>
     <p>To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry</p>
     <p>Rush on in crowds, and the barr’d passage free.</p>
     <p>Ent’ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;</p>
     <p>And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.</p>
     <p>Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,</p>
     <p>And with his ax repeated strokes bestows</p>
     <p>On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,</p>
     <p>Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly.</p>
     <p>He hews apace; the double bars at length</p>
     <p>Yield to his ax and unresisted strength.</p>
     <p>A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal’d</p>
     <p>Appear, and all the palace is reveal’d;</p>
     <p>The halls of audience, and of public state,</p>
     <p>And where the lonely queen in secret sate.</p>
     <p>Arm’d soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,</p>
     <p>With not a door, and scarce a space, between.</p>
     <p>The house is fill’d with loud laments and cries,</p>
     <p>And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;</p>
     <p>The fearful matrons run from place to place,</p>
     <p>And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace.</p>
     <p>The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,</p>
     <p>And all his father sparkles in his eyes;</p>
     <p>Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:</p>
     <p>The bars are broken, and the guards are slain.</p>
     <p>In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill;</p>
     <p>Those few defendants whom they find, they kill.</p>
     <p>Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood</p>
     <p>Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;</p>
     <p>Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,</p>
     <p>And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.</p>
     <p>These eyes beheld him when he march’d between</p>
     <p>The brother kings: I saw th’ unhappy queen,</p>
     <p>The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,</p>
     <p>To stain his hallow’d altar with his brood.</p>
     <p>The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,</p>
     <p>So large a promise, of a progeny),</p>
     <p>The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,</p>
     <p>Fell the reward of the proud victor’s toils.</p>
     <p>Where’er the raging fire had left a space,</p>
     <p>The Grecians enter and possess the place.</p>
     <p>“Perhaps you may of Priam’s fate enquire.</p>
     <p>He, when he saw his regal town on fire,</p>
     <p>His ruin’d palace, and his ent’ring foes,</p>
     <p>On ev’ry side inevitable woes,</p>
     <p>In arms, disus’d, invests his limbs, decay’d,</p>
     <p>Like them, with age; a late and useless aid.</p>
     <p>His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain;</p>
     <p>Loaded, not arm’d, he creeps along with pain,</p>
     <p>Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!</p>
     <p>Uncover’d but by heav’n, there stood in view</p>
     <p>An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,</p>
     <p>Dodder’d with age, whose boughs encompass round</p>
     <p>The household gods, and shade the holy ground.</p>
     <p>Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train</p>
     <p>Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.</p>
     <p>Driv’n like a flock of doves along the sky,</p>
     <p>Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.</p>
     <p>The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,</p>
     <p>And hanging by his side a heavy sword,</p>
     <p>‘What rage,’ she cried, ‘has seiz’d my husband’s mind?</p>
     <p>What arms are these, and to what use design’d?</p>
     <p>These times want other aids! Were Hector here,</p>
     <p>Ev’n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear.</p>
     <p>With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,</p>
     <p>Or in one common fate with us be join’d.’</p>
     <p>She said, and with a last salute embrac’d</p>
     <p>The poor old man, and by the laurel plac’d.</p>
     <p>Behold! Polites, one of Priam’s sons,</p>
     <p>Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.</p>
     <p>Thro’ swords and foes, amaz’d and hurt, he flies</p>
     <p>Thro’ empty courts and open galleries.</p>
     <p>Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,</p>
     <p>And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.</p>
     <p>The youth, transfix’d, with lamentable cries,</p>
     <p>Expires before his wretched parent’s eyes:</p>
     <p>Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,</p>
     <p>The fear of death gave place to nature’s law;</p>
     <p>And, shaking more with anger than with age,</p>
     <p>‘The gods,’ said he, ‘requite thy brutal rage!</p>
     <p>As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,</p>
     <p>If there be gods in heav’n, and gods be just—</p>
     <p>Who tak’st in wrongs an insolent delight;</p>
     <p>With a son’s death t’ infect a father’s sight.</p>
     <p>Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire</p>
     <p>To call thee his—not he, thy vaunted sire,</p>
     <p>Thus us’d my wretched age: the gods he fear’d,</p>
     <p>The laws of nature and of nations heard.</p>
     <p>He cheer’d my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,</p>
     <p>The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;</p>
     <p>Pitied the woes a parent underwent,</p>
     <p>And sent me back in safety from his tent.’</p>
     <p>“This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,</p>
     <p>Which, flutt’ring, seem’d to loiter as it flew:</p>
     <p>Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,</p>
     <p>And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.</p>
     <p>“Then Pyrrhus thus: ‘Go thou from me to fate,</p>
     <p>And to my father my foul deeds relate.</p>
     <p>Now die!’ With that he dragg’d the trembling sire,</p>
     <p>Slidd’ring thro’ clotter’d blood and holy mire,</p>
     <p>(The mingled paste his murder’d son had made,)</p>
     <p>Haul’d from beneath the violated shade,</p>
     <p>And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.</p>
     <p>His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,</p>
     <p>His left he twisted in his hoary hair;</p>
     <p>Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:</p>
     <p>The lukewarm blood came rushing thro’ the wound,</p>
     <p>And sanguine streams distain’d the sacred ground.</p>
     <p>Thus Priam fell, and shar’d one common fate</p>
     <p>With Troy in ashes, and his ruin’d state:</p>
     <p>He, who the scepter of all Asia sway’d,</p>
     <p>Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey’d.</p>
     <p>On the bleak shore now lies th’ abandon’d king,</p>
     <p>A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.</p>
     <p>“Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood</p>
     <p>Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:</p>
     <p>My father’s image fill’d my pious mind,</p>
     <p>Lest equal years might equal fortune find.</p>
     <p>Again I thought on my forsaken wife,</p>
     <p>And trembled for my son’s abandon’d life.</p>
     <p>I look’d about, but found myself alone,</p>
     <p>Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.</p>
     <p>Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress’d,</p>
     <p>Leap’d headlong from the heights; the flames consum’d the rest.</p>
     <p>Thus, wand’ring in my way, without a guide,</p>
     <p>The graceless Helen in the porch I spied</p>
     <p>Of Vesta’s temple; there she lurk’d alone;</p>
     <p>Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:</p>
     <p>But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,</p>
     <p>That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.</p>
     <p>For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;</p>
     <p>More dreads the vengeance of her injur’d lord;</p>
     <p>Ev’n by those gods who refug’d her abhorr’d.</p>
     <p>Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,</p>
     <p>Resolv’d to give her guilt the due reward:</p>
     <p>‘Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,</p>
     <p>And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?</p>
     <p>Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,</p>
     <p>In state attended with a captive crew,</p>
     <p>While unreveng’d the good old Priam falls,</p>
     <p>And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?</p>
     <p>For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood</p>
     <p>Were swell’d with bodies, and were drunk with blood?</p>
     <p>’T is true, a soldier can small honor gain,</p>
     <p>And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:</p>
     <p>Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,</p>
     <p>Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;</p>
     <p>The punish’d crime shall set my soul at ease,</p>
     <p>And murm’ring manes of my friends appease.’</p>
     <p>Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light</p>
     <p>Spread o’er the place; and, shining heav’nly bright,</p>
     <p>My mother stood reveal’d before my sight</p>
     <p>Never so radiant did her eyes appear;</p>
     <p>Not her own star confess’d a light so clear:</p>
     <p>Great in her charms, as when on gods above</p>
     <p>She looks, and breathes herself into their love.</p>
     <p>She held my hand, the destin’d blow to break;</p>
     <p>Then from her rosy lips began to speak:</p>
     <p>‘My son, from whence this madness, this neglect</p>
     <p>Of my commands, and those whom I protect?</p>
     <p>Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind</p>
     <p>Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.</p>
     <p>Look if your helpless father yet survive,</p>
     <p>Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.</p>
     <p>Around your house the greedy Grecians err;</p>
     <p>And these had perish’d in the nightly war,</p>
     <p>But for my presence and protecting care.</p>
     <p>Not Helen’s face, nor Paris, was in fault;</p>
     <p>But by the gods was this destruction brought.</p>
     <p>Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve</p>
     <p>The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,</p>
     <p>Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see</p>
     <p>The shape of each avenging deity.</p>
     <p>Enlighten’d thus, my just commands fulfil,</p>
     <p>Nor fear obedience to your mother’s will.</p>
     <p>Where yon disorder’d heap of ruin lies,</p>
     <p>Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise—</p>
     <p>Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,</p>
     <p>Below the wall’s foundation drives his mace,</p>
     <p>And heaves the building from the solid base.</p>
     <p>Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands</p>
     <p>Full in the Scæan gate, with loud commands,</p>
     <p>Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.</p>
     <p>See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,</p>
     <p>Bestrides the tow’r, refulgent thro’ the cloud:</p>
     <p>See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,</p>
     <p>And arms against the town the partial deities.</p>
     <p>Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end:</p>
     <p>Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:</p>
     <p>Haste; and a mother’s care your passage shall befriend.’</p>
     <p>She said, and swiftly vanish’d from my sight,</p>
     <p>Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.</p>
     <p>I look’d, I listen’d; dreadful sounds I hear;</p>
     <p>And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.</p>
     <p>Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent),</p>
     <p>And Ilium from its old foundations rent;</p>
     <p>Rent like a mountain ash, which dar’d the winds,</p>
     <p>And stood the sturdy strokes of lab’ring hinds.</p>
     <p>About the roots the cruel ax resounds;</p>
     <p>The stumps are pierc’d with oft-repeated wounds:</p>
     <p>The war is felt on high; the nodding crown</p>
     <p>Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down.</p>
     <p>To their united force it yields, tho’ late,</p>
     <p>And mourns with mortal groans th’ approaching fate:</p>
     <p>The roots no more their upper load sustain;</p>
     <p>But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro’ the plain.</p>
     <p>“Descending thence, I scape thro’ foes and fire:</p>
     <p>Before the goddess, foes and flames retire.</p>
     <p>Arriv’d at home, he, for whose only sake,</p>
     <p>Or most for his, such toils I undertake,</p>
     <p>The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight,</p>
     <p>I purpos’d to secure on Ida’s height,</p>
     <p>Refus’d the journey, resolute to die</p>
     <p>And add his fun’rals to the fate of Troy,</p>
     <p>Rather than exile and old age sustain.</p>
     <p>‘Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev’ry vein.</p>
     <p>Had Heav’n decreed that I should life enjoy,</p>
     <p>Heav’n had decreed to save unhappy Troy.</p>
     <p>’T is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one,</p>
     <p>Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown.</p>
     <p>Make haste to save the poor remaining crew,</p>
     <p>And give this useless corpse a long adieu.</p>
     <p>These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;</p>
     <p>At least the pitying foes will aid my death,</p>
     <p>To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:</p>
     <p>As for my sepulcher, let Heav’n take care.</p>
     <p>’T is long since I, for my celestial wife</p>
     <p>Loath’d by the gods, have dragg’d a ling’ring life;</p>
     <p>Since ev’ry hour and moment I expire,</p>
     <p>Blasted from heav’n by Jove’s avenging fire.’</p>
     <p>This oft repeated, he stood fix’d to die:</p>
     <p>Myself, my wife, my son, my family,</p>
     <p>Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry—</p>
     <p>‘What, will he still persist, on death resolve,</p>
     <p>And in his ruin all his house involve!’</p>
     <p>He still persists his reasons to maintain;</p>
     <p>Our pray’rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain.</p>
     <p>“Urg’d by despair, again I go to try</p>
     <p>The fate of arms, resolv’d in fight to die:</p>
     <p>‘What hope remains, but what my death must give?</p>
     <p>Can I, without so dear a father, live?</p>
     <p>You term it prudence, what I baseness call:</p>
     <p>Could such a word from such a parent fall?</p>
     <p>If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain,</p>
     <p>That nothing should of ruin’d Troy remain,</p>
     <p>And you conspire with Fortune to be slain,</p>
     <p>The way to death is wide, th’ approaches near:</p>
     <p>For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,</p>
     <p>Reeking with Priam’s blood—the wretch who slew</p>
     <p>The son (inhuman) in the father’s view,</p>
     <p>And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.</p>
     <p>O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;</p>
     <p>Your gift was undesir’d, and came too late!</p>
     <p>Did you, for this, unhappy me convey</p>
     <p>Thro’ foes and fires, to see my house a prey?</p>
     <p>Shall I my father, wife, and son behold,</p>
     <p>Welt’ring in blood, each other’s arms infold?</p>
     <p>Haste! gird my sword, tho’ spent and overcome:</p>
     <p>’T is the last summons to receive our doom.</p>
     <p>I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call!</p>
     <p>Not unreveng’d the foe shall see my fall.</p>
     <p>Restore me to the yet unfinish’d fight:</p>
     <p>My death is wanting to conclude the night.’</p>
     <p>Arm’d once again, my glitt’ring sword I wield,</p>
     <p>While th’ other hand sustains my weighty shield,</p>
     <p>And forth I rush to seek th’ abandon’d field.</p>
     <p>I went; but sad Creusa stopp’d my way,</p>
     <p>And cross the threshold in my passage lay,</p>
     <p>Embrac’d my knees, and, when I would have gone,</p>
     <p>Shew’d me my feeble sire and tender son:</p>
     <p>‘If death be your design, at least,’ said she,</p>
     <p>‘Take us along to share your destiny.</p>
     <p>If any farther hopes in arms remain,</p>
     <p>This place, these pledges of your love, maintain.</p>
     <p>To whom do you expose your father’s life,</p>
     <p>Your son’s, and mine, your now forgotten wife!’</p>
     <p>While thus she fills the house with clam’rous cries,</p>
     <p>Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:</p>
     <p>For, while I held my son, in the short space</p>
     <p>Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace;</p>
     <p>Strange to relate, from young Iulus’ head</p>
     <p>A lambent flame arose, which gently spread</p>
     <p>Around his brows, and on his temples fed.</p>
     <p>Amaz’d, with running water we prepare</p>
     <p>To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;</p>
     <p>But old Anchises, vers’d in omens, rear’d</p>
     <p>His hands to heav’n, and this request preferr’d:</p>
     <p>‘If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend</p>
     <p>Thy will; if piety can pray’rs commend,</p>
     <p>Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas’d to send.’</p>
     <p>Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear</p>
     <p>A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:</p>
     <p>There shot a streaming lamp along the sky,</p>
     <p>Which on the winged lightning seem’d to fly;</p>
     <p>From o’er the roof the blaze began to move,</p>
     <p>And, trailing, vanish’d in th’ Idæan grove.</p>
     <p>It swept a path in heav’n, and shone a guide,</p>
     <p>Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died.</p>
     <p>“The good old man with suppliant hands implor’d</p>
     <p>The gods’ protection, and their star ador’d.</p>
     <p>‘Now, now,’ said he, ‘my son, no more delay!</p>
     <p>I yield, I follow where Heav’n shews the way.</p>
     <p>Keep, O my country gods, our dwelling place,</p>
     <p>And guard this relic of the Trojan race,</p>
     <p>This tender child! These omens are your own,</p>
     <p>And you can yet restore the ruin’d town.</p>
     <p>At least accomplish what your signs foreshow:</p>
     <p>I stand resign’d, and am prepar’d to go.’</p>
     <p>“He said. The crackling flames appear on high.</p>
     <p>And driving sparkles dance along the sky.</p>
     <p>With Vulcan’s rage the rising winds conspire,</p>
     <p>And near our palace roll the flood of fire.</p>
     <p>‘Haste, my dear father, (’t is no time to wait,)</p>
     <p>And load my shoulders with a willing freight.</p>
     <p>Whate’er befalls, your life shall be my care;</p>
     <p>One death, or one deliv’rance, we will share.</p>
     <p>My hand shall lead our little son; and you,</p>
     <p>My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue.</p>
     <p>Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands:</p>
     <p>Without the walls a ruin’d temple stands,</p>
     <p>To Ceres hallow’d once; a cypress nigh</p>
     <p>Shoots up her venerable head on high,</p>
     <p>By long religion kept; there bend your feet,</p>
     <p>And in divided parties let us meet.</p>
     <p>Our country gods, the relics, and the bands,</p>
     <p>Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:</p>
     <p>In me ’t is impious holy things to bear,</p>
     <p>Red as I am with slaughter, new from war,</p>
     <p>Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt</p>
     <p>Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.’</p>
     <p>Thus, ord’ring all that prudence could provide,</p>
     <p>I clothe my shoulders with a lion’s hide</p>
     <p>And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,</p>
     <p>The welcome load of my dear father take;</p>
     <p>While on my better hand Ascanius hung,</p>
     <p>And with unequal paces tripp’d along.</p>
     <p>Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray</p>
     <p>Thro’ ev’ry dark and ev’ry devious way.</p>
     <p>I, who so bold and dauntless, just before,</p>
     <p>The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore,</p>
     <p>At ev’ry shadow now am seiz’d with fear,</p>
     <p>Not for myself, but for the charge I bear;</p>
     <p>Till, near the ruin’d gate arriv’d at last,</p>
     <p>Secure, and deeming all the danger past,</p>
     <p>A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.</p>
     <p>My father, looking thro’ the shades, with fear,</p>
     <p>Cried out: ‘Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh;</p>
     <p>Their swords and shining armor I descry.’</p>
     <p>Some hostile god, for some unknown offense,</p>
     <p>Had sure bereft my mind of better sense;</p>
     <p>For, while thro’ winding ways I took my flight,</p>
     <p>And sought the shelter of the gloomy night,</p>
     <p>Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell</p>
     <p>If by her fatal destiny she fell,</p>
     <p>Or weary sate, or wander’d with affright;</p>
     <p>But she was lost for ever to my sight.</p>
     <p>I knew not, or reflected, till I meet</p>
     <p>My friends, at Ceres’ now deserted seat.</p>
     <p>We met: not one was wanting; only she</p>
     <p>Deceiv’d her friends, her son, and wretched me.</p>
     <p>“What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!</p>
     <p>Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!</p>
     <p>This was the fatal blow, that pain’d me more</p>
     <p>Than all I felt from ruin’d Troy before.</p>
     <p>Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,</p>
     <p>Abandoning my now forgotten care,</p>
     <p>Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,</p>
     <p>My sire, my son, my country gods I left.</p>
     <p>In shining armor once again I sheathe</p>
     <p>My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death.</p>
     <p>Then headlong to the burning walls I run,</p>
     <p>And seek the danger I was forc’d to shun.</p>
     <p>I tread my former tracks; thro’ night explore</p>
     <p>Each passage, ev’ry street I cross’d before.</p>
     <p>All things were full of horror and affright,</p>
     <p>And dreadful ev’n the silence of the night.</p>
     <p>Then to my father’s house I make repair,</p>
     <p>With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.</p>
     <p>Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;</p>
     <p>The house was fill’d with foes, with flames beset.</p>
     <p>Driv’n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,</p>
     <p>Thro’ air transported, to the roofs aspire.</p>
     <p>From thence to Priam’s palace I resort,</p>
     <p>And search the citadel and desart court.</p>
     <p>Then, unobserv’d, I pass by Juno’s church:</p>
     <p>A guard of Grecians had possess’d the porch;</p>
     <p>There Phoenix and Ulysses watch the prey,</p>
     <p>And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:</p>
     <p>The spoils which they from ransack’d houses brought,</p>
     <p>And golden bowls from burning altars caught,</p>
     <p>The tables of the gods, the purple vests,</p>
     <p>The people’s treasure, and the pomp of priests.</p>
     <p>A rank of wretched youths, with pinion’d hands,</p>
     <p>And captive matrons, in long order stands.</p>
     <p>Then, with ungovern’d madness, I proclaim,</p>
     <p>Thro’ all the silent street, Creusa’s name:</p>
     <p>Creusa still I call; at length she hears,</p>
     <p>And sudden thro’ the shades of night appears—</p>
     <p>Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,</p>
     <p>But a pale specter, larger than the life.</p>
     <p>Aghast, astonish’d, and struck dumb with fear,</p>
     <p>I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen’d hair.</p>
     <p>Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief</p>
     <p>‘Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.</p>
     <p>Desist, my much-lov’d lord, ’t indulge your pain;</p>
     <p>You bear no more than what the gods ordain.</p>
     <p>My fates permit me not from hence to fly;</p>
     <p>Nor he, the great controller of the sky.</p>
     <p>Long wand’ring ways for you the pow’rs decree;</p>
     <p>On land hard labors, and a length of sea.</p>
     <p>Then, after many painful years are past,</p>
     <p>On Latium’s happy shore you shall be cast,</p>
     <p>Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds</p>
     <p>The flow’ry meadows, and the feeding folds.</p>
     <p>There end your toils; and there your fates provide</p>
     <p>A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:</p>
     <p>There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,</p>
     <p>And you for lost Creusa weep no more.</p>
     <p>Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,</p>
     <p>Th’ imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;</p>
     <p>Or, stooping to the victor’s lust, disgrace</p>
     <p>My goddess mother, or my royal race.</p>
     <p>And now, farewell! The parent of the gods</p>
     <p>Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:</p>
     <p>I trust our common issue to your care.’</p>
     <p>She said, and gliding pass’d unseen in air.</p>
     <p>I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;</p>
     <p>And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,</p>
     <p>And, thrice deceiv’d, on vain embraces hung.</p>
     <p>Light as an empty dream at break of day,</p>
     <p>Or as a blast of wind, she rush’d away.</p>
     <p>“Thus having pass’d the night in fruitless pain,</p>
     <p>I to my longing friends return again,</p>
     <p>Amaz’d th’ augmented number to behold,</p>
     <p>Of men and matrons mix’d, of young and old;</p>
     <p>A wretched exil’d crew together brought,</p>
     <p>With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,</p>
     <p>Resolv’d, and willing, under my command,</p>
     <p>To run all hazards both of sea and land.</p>
     <p>The Morn began, from Ida, to display</p>
     <p>Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:</p>
     <p>Before the gates the Grecians took their post,</p>
     <p>And all pretense of late relief was lost.</p>
     <p>I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire,</p>
     <p>And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.”</p>

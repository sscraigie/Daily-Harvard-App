     <p>6. Now friendship may be thus defined: a complete accord on all subjects human and divine, joined with mutual good</p>
     <p>will and affection. And with the exception of wisdom, I am inclined to think nothing better than this has been given</p>
     <p>to man by the immortal gods. There are people who give the palm to riches or to good health, or to power and office,</p>
     <p>many even to sensual pleasures. This last is the ideal of brute beasts; and of the others we may say that they are frail</p>
     <p>and uncertain, and depend less on our own prudence than on the caprice of fortune. Then there are those who find</p>
     <p>the “chief good” in virtue. Well, that is a noble doctrine. But the very virtue they talk of is the parent and preserver</p>
     <p>of friendship, and without it friendship cannot possibly exist.</p>
     <p>Let us, I repeat, use the word virtue in the ordinary acceptation and meaning of the term, and do not let us define it</p>
     <p>in high-flown language. Let us account as good the persons usually considered so, such as Paulus, Cato, Gallus, Scipio,</p>
     <p>and Philus. Such men as these are good enough for everyday life; and we need not trouble ourselves about those ideal</p>
     <p>characters which are nowhere to be met with.</p>
     <p>Well, between men like these the advantages of friendship are almost more than I can say. To begin with, how can</p>
     <p>life be worth living, to use the words of Ennius, which lacks that repose which is to be found in the mutual good will</p>
     <p>of a friend? What can be more delightful than to have some one to whom you can say everything with the same</p>
     <p>absolute confidence as to yourself? Is not prosperity robbed of half its value if you have no one to share your joy? On</p>
     <p>the other hand, misfortunes would be hard to bear if there were not some one to feel them even more acutely than</p>
     <p>yourself. In a word, other objects of ambition serve for particular ends—riches for use, power for securing homage,</p>
     <p>office for reputation, pleasure for enjoyment, health for freedom from pain and the full use of the functions of the</p>
     <p>body. But friendship embraces innumerable advantages. Turn which way you please, you will find it at hand. It is</p>
     <p>everywhere; and yet never out of place, never unwelcome. Fire and water themselves, to use a common expression,</p>
     <p>are not of more universal use than friendship. I am not now speaking of the common or modified form of it, though</p>
     <p>even that is a source of pleasure and profit, but of that true and complete friendship which existed between the</p>
     <p>select few who are known to fame. Such friendship enhances prosperity, and relieves adversity of its burden by</p>
     <p>halving and sharing it.</p>
     <p>7. And great and numerous as are the blessings of friendship, this certainly is the sovereign one, that it gives us bright</p>
     <p>hopes for the future and forbids weakness and despair. In the face of a true friend a man sees as it were a second</p>
     <p>self. So that where his friend is he is; if his friend be rich, he is not poor; though he be weak, his friend’s strength is</p>
     <p>his; and in his friend’s life he enjoys a second life after his own is finished. This last is perhaps the most difficult to</p>
     <p>conceive. But such is the effect of the respect, the loving remembrance, and the regret of friends which follow us to</p>
     <p>the grave. While they take the sting out of death, they add a glory to the life of the survivors. Nay, if you eliminate</p>
     <p>from nature the tie of affection, there will be an end of house and city, nor will so much as the cultivation of the soil</p>
     <p>be left. If you don’t see the virtue of friendship and harmony, you may learn it by observing the effects of quarrels</p>
     <p>and feuds. Was any family ever so well established, any State so firmly settled, as to be beyond the reach of utter</p>
     <p>destruction from animosities and factions? This may teach you the immense advantage of friendship.</p>
     <p>They say that a certain philosopher of Agrigentum, in a Greek poem, pronounced with the authority of an oracle the</p>
     <p>doctrine that whatever in nature and the universe was unchangeable was so in virtue of the binding force of</p>
     <p>friendship; whatever was changeable was so by the solvent power of discord. And indeed this is a truth which</p>
     <p>everybody understands and practically attests by experience. For if any marked instance of loyal friendship in</p>
     <p>confronting or sharing danger comes to light, every one applauds it to the echo. What cheers there were, for</p>
     <p>instance, all over the theatre at a passage in the new play of my friend and guest Pacuvius; where, the king not</p>
     <p>knowing which of the two was Orestes, Pylades declared himself to be Orestes, that he might die in his stead, while</p>
     <p>the real Orestes kept on asserting that it was he. The audience rose en masse and clapped their hands. And this was</p>
     <p>at an incident in fiction: what would they have done, must we suppose, if it had been in real life? You can easily see</p>
     <p>what a natural feeling it is, when men who would not have had the resolution to act thus themselves, shewed how</p>
     <p>right they thought it in another.</p>
     <p>I don’t think I have any more to say about friendship. If there is any more, and I have no doubt there is much, you</p>
     <p>must, if you care to do so, consult those who profess to discuss such matters.</p>
     <p>Fannius. We would rather apply to you. Yet I have often consulted such persons, and have heard what they had to say</p>
     <p>with a certain satisfaction. But in your discourse one somehow feels that there is a different strain.</p>
     <p>Scævola. You would have said that still more, Fannius, if you had been present the other day in Scipio’s pleasuregrounds</p>
     <p>when we had the discussion about the State. How splendidly he stood up for justice against Philus’ elaborate</p>
     <p>speech!</p>
     <p>Fannius. Ah! it was naturally easy for the justest of men to stand up for justice.</p>
     <p>Scævola. Well, then, what about friendship? Who could discourse on it more easily than the man whose chief glory is</p>
     <p>a friendship maintained with the most absolute fidelity, constancy, and integrity?</p>
     <p>8. Lælius. Now you are really using force. It makes no difference what kind of force you use: force it is. For it is</p>
     <p>neither easy nor right to refuse a wish of my sons-in-law, particularly when the wish is a creditable one in itself.</p>
     <p>Well, then, it has very often occurred to me when thinking about friendship, that the chief point to be considered</p>
     <p>was this: is it weakness and want of means that make friendship desired? I mean, is its object an interchange of good</p>
     <p>offices, so that each may give that in which he is strong, and receive that in which he is weak? Or is it not rather true</p>
     <p>that, although this is an advantage naturally belonging to friendship, yet its original cause is quite other, prior in</p>
     <p>time, more noble in character, and springing more directly from our nature itself? The Latin word for friendship—</p>
     <p>amicitia—is derived from that for love—amor; and love is certainly the prime mover in contracting mutual affection.</p>
     <p>For as to material advantages, it often happens that those are obtained even by men who are courted by a mere show</p>
     <p>of friendship and treated with respect from interested motives. But friendship by its nature admits of no feigning, no</p>
     <p>pretence: as far as it goes it is both genuine and spontaneous. Therefore I gather that friendship springs from a</p>
     <p>natural impulse rather than a wish for help: from an inclination of the heart, combined with a certain instinctive</p>
     <p>feeling of love, rather than from a deliberate calculation of the material advantage it was likely to confer. The</p>
     <p>strength of this feeling you may notice in certain animals. They show such love to their offspring for a certain period,</p>
     <p>and are so beloved by them, that they clearly have a share in this natural, instinctive affection. But of course it is</p>
     <p>more evident in the case of man: first, in the natural affection between children and their parents, an affection</p>
     <p>which only shocking wickedness can sunder: and next, when the passion of love has attained to a like strength—on our</p>
     <p>finding, that is, some one person with whose character and nature we are in full sympathy, because we think that we</p>
     <p>perceive in him what I may call the beacon-light of virtue. For nothing inspires love, nothing conciliates affection,</p>
     <p>like virtue. Why, in a certain sense we may be said to feel affection even for men we have never seen, owing to their</p>
     <p>honesty and virtue. Who, for instance, fails to dwell on the memory of Gaius Fabricius and Manius Curius with some</p>
     <p>affection and warmth of feeling, though he has never seen them? Or who but loathes Tarquinius Superbus, Spurius</p>
     <p>Cassius, Spurius Mælius? We have fought for empire in Italy with two great generals, Pyrrhus and Hannibal. For the</p>
     <p>former, owing to his probity, we entertain no great feelings of enmity: the latter, owing to his cruelty, our country has</p>
     <p>detested and always will detest.</p>
     <p>9. Now, if the attraction of probity is so great that we can love it not only in those whom we have never seen, but,</p>
     <p>what is more, actually in an enemy, we need not be surprised if men’s affections are roused when they fancy that</p>
     <p>they have seen virtue and goodness in those with whom a close intimacy is possible. I do not deny that affection is</p>
     <p>strengthened by the actual receipt of benefits, as well as by the perception of a wish to render service, combined</p>
     <p>with a closer intercourse. When these are added to the original impulse of the heart, to which I have alluded, a quite</p>
     <p>surprising warmth of feeling springs up. And if any one thinks that this comes from a sense of weakness, that each</p>
     <p>may have some one to help him to his particular need, all I can say is that, when he maintains it to be born of want</p>
     <p>and poverty, he allows to friendship an origin very base, and a pedigree, if I may be allowed the expression, far from</p>
     <p>noble. If this had been the case, a man’s inclination to friendship would be exactly in proportion to his low opinion of</p>
     <p>his own resources. Whereas the truth is quite the other way. For when a man’s confidence in himself is greatest,</p>
     <p>when he is so fortified by virtue and wisdom as to want nothing and to feel absolutely self-dependent, it is then that</p>
     <p>he is most conspicuous for seeking out and keeping up friendships. Did Africanus, for example, want anything of me?</p>
     <p>Not the least in the world! Neither did I of him. In my case it was an admiration of his virtue, in his an opinion,</p>
     <p>maybe, which he entertained of my character, that caused our affection. Closer intimacy added to the warmth of our</p>
     <p>feelings. But though many great material advantages did ensue, they were not the source from which our affection</p>
     <p>proceeded. For as we are not beneficent and liberal with any view of extorting gratitude, and do not regard an act of</p>
     <p>kindness as an investment, but follow a natural inclination to liberality; so we look on friendship as worth trying for,</p>
     <p>not because we are attracted to it by the expectation of ulterior gain, but in the conviction that what it has to give</p>
     <p>us is from first to last included in the feeling itself.</p>
     <p>Far different is the view of those who, like brute beasts, refer everything to sensual pleasure. And no wonder. Men</p>
     <p>who have degraded all their powers of thought to an object so mean and contemptible can of course raise their eyes</p>
     <p>to nothing lofty, to nothing grand and divine. Such persons indeed let us leave out of the present question. And let us</p>
     <p>accept the doctrine that the sensation of love and the warmth of inclination have their origin in a spontaneous feeling</p>
     <p>which arises directly the presence of probity is indicated. When once men have conceived the inclination, they of</p>
     <p>course try to attach themselves to the object of it, and move themselves nearer and nearer to him. Their aim is that</p>
     <p>they may be on the same footing and the same level in regard to affection, and be more inclined to do a good service</p>
     <p>than to ask a return, and that there should be this noble rivalry between them. Thus both truths will be established.</p>
     <p>We shall get the most important material advantages from friendship; and its origin from a natural impulse rather</p>
     <p>than from a sense of need will be at once more dignified and more in accordance with fact. For if it were true that its</p>
     <p>material advantages cemented friendship, it would be equally true that any change in them would dissolve it. But</p>
     <p>nature being incapable of change, it follows that genuine friendships are eternal.</p>
     <p>So much for the origin of friendship. But perhaps you would not care to hear any more.</p>
     <p>Fannius. Nay, pray go on; let us have the rest, Lælius. I take on myself to speak for my friend here as his senior.</p>
     <p>Scævola. Quite right! Therefore, pray let us hear.</p>
     <p>10. Lælius. Well, then, my good friends, listen to some conversations about friendship which very frequently passed</p>
     <p>between Scipio and myself. I must begin by telling you, however, that he used to say that the most difficult thing in</p>
     <p>the world was for a friendship to remain unimpaired to the end of life. So many things might intervene: conflicting</p>
     <p>interests; differences of opinion in politics; frequent changes in character, owing sometimes to misfortunes,</p>
     <p>sometimes to advancing years. He used to illustrate these facts from the analogy of boyhood, since the warmest</p>
     <p>affections between boys are often laid aside with the boyish toga; and even if they did manage to keep them up to</p>
     <p>adolescence, they were sometimes broken by a rivalry in courtship, or for some other advantage to which their</p>
     <p>mutual claims were not compatible. Even if the friendship was prolonged beyond that time, yet it frequently received</p>
     <p>a rude shock should the two happen to be competitors for office. For while the most fatal blow to friendship in the</p>
     <p>majority of cases was the lust of gold, in the case of the best men it was a rivalry for office and reputation, by which</p>
     <p>it had often happened that the most violent enmity had arisen between the closest friends.</p>
     <p>Again, wide breaches and, for the most part, justifiable ones were caused by an immoral request being made of</p>
     <p>friends, to pander to a man’s unholy desires or to assist him in inflicting a wrong. A refusal, though perfectly right, is</p>
     <p>attacked by those to whom they refuse compliance as a violation of the laws of friendship. Now the people who have</p>
     <p>no scruples as to the requests they make to their friends, thereby allow that they are ready to have no scruples as to</p>
     <p>what they will do for their friends; and it is the recriminations of such people which commonly not only quench</p>
     <p>friendships, but give rise to lasting enmities. “In fact,” he used to say, “these fatalities overhang friendship in such</p>
     <p>numbers that it requires not only wisdom but good luck also to escape them all.”</p>
     <p>11. With these premises, then, let us first, if you please, examine the question—how far ought personal feeling to go</p>
     <p>in friendship? For instance: suppose Coriolanus to have had friends, ought they to have joined him in invading his</p>
     <p>country? Again, in the case of Vecellinus or Spurius Mælius, ought their friends to have assisted them in their attempt</p>
     <p>to establish a tyranny? Take two instances of either line of conduct. When Tiberius Gracchus attempted his</p>
     <p>revolutionary measures he was deserted, as we saw, by Quintus Tubero and the friends of his own standing. On the</p>
     <p>other hand, a friend of your own family, Scævola, Gaius Blossius of Cumæ, took a different course. I was acting as</p>
     <p>assessor to the consuls Lænas and Rupilius to try the conspirators, and Blossius pleaded for my pardon on the ground</p>
     <p>that his regard for Tiberius Gracchus had been so high that he looked upon his wishes as law. “Even if he had wished</p>
     <p>you to set fire to the Capitol?” said I. “That is a thing,” he replied, “that he never would have wished.” “Ah, but if he</p>
     <p>had wished it?” said I. “I would have obeyed.” The wickedness of such a speech needs no comment. And in point of</p>
     <p>fact he was as good and better than his word; for he did not wait for orders in the audacious proceedings of Tiberius</p>
     <p>Gracchus, but was the head and front of them, and was a leader rather than an abettor of his madness. The result of</p>
     <p>his infatuation was that he fled to Asia, terrified by the special commission appointed to try him, joined the enemies</p>
     <p>of his country, and paid a penalty to the republic as heavy as it was deserved. I conclude, then, that the plea of</p>
     <p>having acted in the interests of a friend is not a valid excuse for a wrong action. For, seeing that a belief in a man’s</p>
     <p>virtue is the original cause of friendship, friendship can hardly remain if virtue be abandoned. But if we decide it to</p>
     <p>be right to grant our friends whatever they wish, and to ask them for whatever we wish, perfect wisdom must be</p>
     <p>assumed on both sides if no mischief is to happen. But we cannot assume this perfect wisdom; for we are speaking</p>
     <p>only of such friends as are ordinarily to be met with, whether we have actually seen them or have been told about</p>
     <p>them—men, that is to say, of everyday life. I must quote some examples of such persons, taking care to select such as</p>
     <p>approach nearest to our standard of wisdom. We read, for instance, that Papus Aemilius was a close friend of Gaius</p>
     <p>Luscinus. History tells us that they were twice consuls together, and colleagues in the censorship. Again, it is on</p>
     <p>record that Manius Curius and Tiberius Coruncanius were on the most intimate terms with them and with each other.</p>
     <p>Now, we cannot even suspect that any one of these men ever asked of his friend anything that militated against his</p>
     <p>honour or his oath or the interests of the republic. In the case of such men as these there is no point in saying that</p>
     <p>one of them would not have obtained such a request if he had made it; for they were men of the most scrupulous</p>
     <p>piety, and the making of such a request would involve a breach of religious obligation no less than the granting it.</p>
     <p>However, it is quite true that Gaius Carbo and Gaius Cato did follow Tiberius Gracchus; and though his brother Gaius</p>
     <p>Gracchus did not do so at the time, he is now the most eager of them all.</p>
     <p>12. We may then lay down this rule of friendship—neither ask nor consent to do what is wrong. For the plea “for</p>
     <p>friendship’s sake” is a discreditable one, and not to be admitted for a moment. This rule holds good for all wrongdoing,</p>
     <p>but more especially in such as involves disloyalty to the republic. For things have come to such a point with us,</p>
     <p>my dear Fannius and Scævola, that we are bound to look somewhat far ahead to what is likely to happen to the</p>
     <p>republic. The constitution, as known to our ancestors, has already swerved somewhat from the regular course and the</p>
     <p>lines marked out for it. Tiberius Gracchus made an attempt to obtain the power of a king, or, I might rather say,</p>
     <p>enjoyed that power for a few months. Had the Roman people ever heard or seen the like before? What the friends</p>
     <p>and connexions that followed him, even after his death, have succeeded in doing in the case of Publius Scipio I cannot</p>
     <p>describe without tears. As for Carbo, thanks to the punishment recently inflicted on Tiberius Gracchus, we have by</p>
     <p>hook or by crook managed to hold out against his attacks. But what to expect of the tribuneship of Gaius Gracchus I</p>
     <p>do not like to forecast. One thing leads to another; and once set going, the downward course proceeds with everincreasing</p>
     <p>velocity. There is the case of the ballot: what a blow was inflicted first by the lex Gabinia, and two years</p>
     <p>afterwards by the lex Cassia! I seem already to see the people estranged from the Senate, and the most important</p>
     <p>affairs at the mercy of the multitude. For you may be sure that more people will learn how to set such things in</p>
     <p>motion than how to stop them. What is the point of these remarks? This: no one ever makes any attempt of this sort</p>
     <p>without friends to help him. We must therefore impress upon good men that, should they become inevitably involved</p>
     <p>in friendships with men of this kind, they ought not to consider themselves under any obligation to stand by friends</p>
     <p>who are disloyal to the republic. Bad men must have the fear of punishment before their eyes: a punishment not less</p>
     <p>severe for those who follow than for those who lead others to crime. Who was more famous and powerful in Greece</p>
     <p>than Themistocles? At the head of the army in the Persian war he had freed Greece; he owed his exile to personal</p>
     <p>envy: but he did not submit to the wrong done him by his ungrateful country as he ought to have done. He acted as</p>
     <p>Coriolanus had acted among us twenty years before. But no one was found to help them in their attacks upon their</p>
     <p>fatherland. Both of them accordingly committed suicide.</p>
     <p>We conclude, then, not only that no such confederation of evilly disposed men must be allowed to shelter itself under</p>
     <p>the plea of friendship, but that, on the contrary, it must be visited with the severest punishment, lest the idea should</p>
     <p>prevail that fidelity to a friend justifies even making war upon one’s country. And this is a case which I am inclined to</p>
     <p>think, considering how things are beginning to go, will sooner or later arise. And I care quite as much what the state</p>
     <p>of the constitution will be after my death as what it is now.</p>
     <p>13. Let this, then, be laid down as the first law of friendship, that we should ask from friends, and do for friends,</p>
     <p>only what is good. But do not let us wait to be asked either: let there be ever an eager readiness, and an absence of</p>
     <p>hesitation. Let us have the courage to give advice with candour. In friendship, let the influence of friends who give</p>
     <p>good advice be paramount; and let this influence be used to enforce advice not only in plain-spoken terms, but</p>
     <p>sometimes, if the case demands it, with sharpness; and when so used, let it be obeyed.</p>
     <p>I give you these rules because I believe that some wonderful opinions are entertained by certain persons who have, I</p>
     <p>am told, a reputation for wisdom in Greece. There is nothing in the world, by the way, beyond the reach of their</p>
     <p>sophistry. Well, some of them teach that we should avoid very close friendships, for fear that one man should have to</p>
     <p>endure the anxieties of several. Each man, say they, has enough and to spare on his own hands; it is too bad to be</p>
     <p>involved in the cares of other people. The wisest course is to hold the reins of friendship as loose as possible; you can</p>
     <p>then tighten or slacken them at your will. For the first condition of a happy life is freedom from care, which no one’s</p>
     <p>mind can enjoy if it has to travail, so to speak, for others besides itself. Another sect, I am told, gives vent to</p>
     <p>opinions still less generous. I briefly touched on this subject just now. They affirm that friendships should be sought</p>
     <p>solely for the sake of the assistance they give, and not at all from motives of feeling and affection; and that therefore</p>
     <p>just in proportion as a man’s power and means of support are lowest, he is most eager to gain friendships: thence it</p>
     <p>comes that weak women seek the support of friendship more than men, the poor more than the rich, the unfortunate</p>
     <p>rather than those esteemed prosperous. What noble philosophy! You might just as well take the sun out of the sky as</p>
     <p>friendship from life; for the immortal gods have given us nothing better or more delightful.</p>
     <p>But let us examine the two doctrines. What is the value of this “freedom from care”? It is very tempting at first sight,</p>
     <p>but in practice it has in many cases to be put on one side. For there is no business and no course of action demanded</p>
     <p>from us by our honour which you can consistently decline, or lay aside when begun, from a mere wish to escape from</p>
     <p>anxiety. Nay, if we wish to avoid anxiety we must avoid virtue itself, which necessarily involves some anxious thoughts</p>
     <p>in showing its loathing and abhorrence for the qualities which are opposite to itself—as kindness for ill nature, selfcontrol</p>
     <p>for licentiousness, courage for cowardice. Thus you may notice that it is the just who are most pained at</p>
     <p>injustice, the brave at cowardly actions, the temperate at depravity. It is then characteristic of a rightly ordered</p>
     <p>mind to be pleased at what is good and grieved at the reverse. Seeing then that the wise are not exempt from the</p>
     <p>heart-ache (which must be the case unless we suppose all human nature rooted out of their hearts), why should we</p>
     <p>banish friendship from our lives, for fear of being involved by it in some amount of distress? If you take away emotion,</p>
     <p>what difference remains I don’t say between a man and a beast, but between a man and a stone or a log of wood, or</p>
     <p>anything else of that kind?</p>
     <p>Neither should we give any weight to the doctrine that virtue is something rigid and unyielding as iron. In point of</p>
     <p>fact it is in regard to friendship, as in so many other things, so supple and sensitive that it expands, so to speak, at a</p>
     <p>friend’s good fortune, contracts at his misfortunes. We conclude then that mental pain which we must often</p>
     <p>encounter on a friend’s account is not of sufficient consequence to banish friendship from our life, any more than it is</p>
     <p>true that the cardinal virtues are to be dispensed with because they involve certain anxieties and distresses.</p>

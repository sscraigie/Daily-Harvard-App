     <p>To this end, disposing of all his companies, according as they inclined most; he left the</p>
     <p>three ships and the caravel with Captain RANSE; and chose into his four pinnaces (Captain</p>
     <p>RANSE'S shallop made the fourth) beside fifty-three of our men, twenty more of Captain</p>
     <p>RANSE'S company; with which he seemed competently furnished, to achieve what he</p>
     <p>intended; especially having proportioned, according to his own purpose, and our men's</p>
     <p>disposition, their several arms, viz., six targets, six firepikes, twelve pikes, twenty-four</p>
     <p>muskets and calivers, sixteen bows, and six partisans, two drums, and two trumpets.</p>
     <p>Thus having parted (23rd July) from our company: we arrived at the island of Cativaas,</p>
     <p>being twenty-five leagues distant, about five days afterward (28th July). There we landed</p>
     <p>all in the morning betimes: and our Captain trained his men, delivering them their several</p>
     <p>weapons and arms which hitherto he had kept very fair and safe in good caske [casks]: and</p>
     <p>exhorting them after his manner, he declared &quot;the greatness of the hope of good things</p>
     <p>that was there! the weakness of the town, being unwalled! and the hope he had of</p>
     <p>prevailing to recompense his wrongs! especially now that he should come with such a crew,</p>
     <p>who were like-minded with himself; and at such a time, as he should be utterly</p>
     <p>undiscovered.&quot;</p>
     <p>Therefore, even that afternoon, he causeth us to set sail for Nombre de Dios, so that</p>
     <p>before sunset we were as far as Rio Francisco. Thence, he led us hard aboard the shore,</p>
     <p>that we might not be descried of the Watch House, until that being come within two</p>
     <p>leagues of the point of the bay, he caused us to strike a hull, and cast our grappers</p>
     <p>[grappling irons], riding so until it was dark night.</p>
     <p>Then we weighed again, and set sail, rowing hard aboard the shore, with as much silence</p>
     <p>as we could, till we recovered the point of the harbour under the high land. There, we</p>
     <p>stayed, all silent; purposing to attempt the town in the dawning of the day: after that we</p>
     <p>had reposed ourselves, for a while.</p>
     <p>But our Captain with some other of his best men, finding that our people were talking of</p>
     <p>the greatness of the town, and what their strength might be; especially by the report of</p>
     <p>the Negroes that we took at the Isle of Pinos: thought it best to put these conceits out of</p>
     <p>their heads, and therefore to take the opportunity of the rising of the moon that night,</p>
     <p>persuading them that &quot;it was the day dawning.&quot; By this occasion we were at the town a</p>
     <p>large hour sooner then first was purposed. For we arrived there by three of the clock after</p>
     <p>midnight. At what time it fortuned that a ship of Spain, of 60 tons, laden with Canary</p>
     <p>wines and other commodities, which had but lately come into the bay; and had not yet</p>
     <p>furled her sprit-sail (espying our four pinnaces, being an extraordinary number, and those</p>
     <p>rowing with many oars) sent away her gundeloe [gondola ?] towards the town, to give</p>
     <p>warning. But our Captain perceiving it, cut betwixt her and the town, forcing her to go to</p>
     <p>the other side of the bay: whereby we landed without impeachment, although we found</p>
     <p>one gunner upon the Platform [battery] in the very place where we landed; being a sandy</p>
     <p>place and no key [quay] at all, not past twenty yards from the houses.</p>
     <p>There we found six great pieces of brass ordnance, mounted upon their carriages, some</p>
     <p>Demy, some Whole-Culvering.</p>
     <p>We presently dismounted them. The gunner fled. The town took alarm (being very ready</p>
     <p>thereto, by reason of their often disquieting by their near neighbours the Cimaroons); as</p>
     <p>we perceived, not only by the noise and cries of the people, but by the bell ringing out,</p>
     <p>and drums running up and down the town.</p>
     <p>Our Captain, according to the directions which he had given over night, to such as he had</p>
     <p>made choice of for the purpose, left twelve to keep the pinnaces; that we might be sure of</p>
     <p>a safe retreat, if the worst befell. And having made sure work of the Platform before he</p>
     <p>would enter the town, he thought best, first to view the Mount on the east side of the</p>
     <p>town: where he was informed, by sundry intelligences the year before, they had an intent</p>
     <p>to plant ordnance, which might scour round about the town.</p>
     <p>Therefore, leaving one half of his company to make a stand at the foot of the Mount, he</p>
     <p>marched up presently unto the top of it, with all speed to try the truth of the report, for</p>
     <p>the more safety. There we found no piece of ordnance, but only a very fit place prepared</p>
     <p>for such use, and therefore we left it without any of our men, and with all celerity</p>
     <p>returned now down the Mount.</p>
     <p>Then our Captain appointed his brother, with JOHN OXNAM [or OXENHAM] and sixteen other</p>
     <p>of his men, to go about, behind the King's Treasure House, and enter near the easter[n] end</p>
     <p>of the Market Place: himself with the rest, would pass up the broad street into the Market</p>
     <p>Place, with sound of drum and trumpet. The Firepikes, divided half to the one, and half to</p>
     <p>the other company, served no less for fright to the enemy than light of our men, who by his</p>
     <p>means might discern every place very well, as if it were near day: whereas the inhabitants</p>
     <p>stood amazed at so strange a sight, marvelling what the matter might be, and imagining,</p>
     <p>by reason of our drums and trumpets sounding in so sundry places, that we had been a far</p>
     <p>greater number then we were.</p>
     <p>Yet, by means of the soldiers of which were in the town, and by reason of the time which</p>
     <p>we spent in marching up and down the Mount, the soldiers and inhabitants had put</p>
     <p>themselves in arms, and brought their companies in some order, at the south-east end of</p>
     <p>the Market Place, near the Governor's House, and not far from the gate of the town, which</p>
     <p>is the only one, leading towards Panama: having (as it seems) gathered themselves thither,</p>
     <p>either that in the Governor's sight they might shew their valour, if it might prevail; or else,</p>
     <p>that by the gate they might best take their Vale, and escape readiest.</p>
     <p>And to make a shew of far greater numbers of shot, or else of a custom they had, by the</p>
     <p>like device to terrify the Cimaroons; they had hung lines with matches lighted, overthwart</p>
     <p>the wester[n] end of the Market Place, between the Church and the Cross; as though there</p>
     <p>had been in a readiness some company of shot, whereas indeed there were not past two or</p>
     <p>three that taught these lines to dance, till they themselves ran away, as soon as they</p>
     <p>perceived they were discovered.</p>
     <p>But the soldiers and such as were joined with them, presented us with a jolly hot volley of</p>
     <p>shot, beating full upon the full egress of that street, in which we marched; and levelling</p>
     <p>very low, so as their bullets ofttimes grazed on the sand.</p>
     <p>We stood not to answer them in like terms: but having discharged our first volley of shot,</p>
     <p>and feathered them with our arrows (which our Captain had caused to be made of purpose</p>
     <p>in England; not great sheaf arrows, but fine roving shafts, very carefully reserved for the</p>
     <p>service) we came to the push of pike, so that our firepikes being well armed and made of</p>
     <p>purpose, did us very great service.</p>
     <p>For our men with their pikes and short weapons, in short time took such order among these</p>
     <p>gallants (some using the butt-end of their pieces instead of other weapons), that partly by</p>
     <p>reason of our arrows which did us there notable service, partly by occasion of this strange</p>
     <p>and sudden closing with them in this manner unlooked for, and the rather for that at the</p>
     <p>very instant, our Captain's brother, with the other company, with their firepikes, entered</p>
     <p>the Market Place by the easter[n] street: they casting down their weapons, fled all out of</p>
     <p>the town by the gate aforesaid, which had been built for a bar to keep out of the town the</p>
     <p>Cimaroons, who had often assailed it; but now served for a gap for the Spaniards to fly at.</p>
     <p>In following, and returning divers of our men were hurt with the weapons which the enemy</p>
     <p>had let fall as he fled; somewhat, for that we marched with such speed, but more for that</p>
     <p>they lay so thick and cross one on the other.</p>
     <p>Being returned, we made our stand near the midst of the Market Place, where a tree</p>
     <p>groweth hard by the Cross; whence our Captain sent some of our men to stay the ringing of</p>
     <p>the alarm bell, which had continued all this while: but the church being very strongly built</p>
     <p>and fast shut, they could not without firing (which our Captain forbade) get into the</p>
     <p>steeple where the bell rung.</p>
     <p>In the meantime, our Captain having taken two or three Spaniards in their flight,</p>
     <p>commanded them to shew him the Governor's House, where he understood was the</p>
     <p>ordinary place of unlading the moiles [mules] of all the treasure which came from Panama</p>
     <p>by the King's appointment. Although the silver only was kept there; the gold, pearl, and</p>
     <p>jewels (being there once entered by the King's officer) was carried from thence to the</p>
     <p>King's Treasure House not far off, being a house very strongly built of lime and stone, for</p>
     <p>the safe keeping thereof.</p>
     <p>At our coming to the Governor's House, we found the great door where the mules do</p>
     <p>usually unlade, even then opened, a candle lighted upon the top of the stairs; and a fair</p>
     <p>gennet ready saddled, either for the Governor himself, or some other of his household to</p>
     <p>carry it after him. By means of this light we saw a huge heap of silver in that nether</p>
     <p>[lower] room; being a pile of bars of silver of, as near as we could guess, seventy feet in</p>
     <p>length, of ten feet in breadth, and twelve feet in height, piled up against the wall, each</p>
     <p>bar was between thirty-five and forty pounds in weight.</p>
     <p>At sight hereof, our Captain commanded straightly that none of us should touch a bar of</p>
     <p>silver; but stand upon our weapons, because the town was full of people, and there was in</p>
     <p>the King's Treasure House near the water side, more gold and jewels than all our four</p>
     <p>pinnaces could carry: which we would presently set some in hand to break open,</p>
     <p>notwithstanding the Spaniards report the strength of it.</p>
     <p>We were no sooner returned to our strength, but there was a report brought by some of our</p>
     <p>men that our pinnaces were in danger to be taken; and that if we ourselves got not aboard</p>
     <p>before day, we should be oppressed with multitude both of soldiers and towns-people. This</p>
     <p>report had his ground from one DIEGO a Negro, who, in the time of the first conflict, came</p>
     <p>and called to our pinnaces, to know &quot;whether they were Captain DRAKE'S?&quot; And upon</p>
     <p>answer received, continued entreating to be taken aboard, though he had first three or</p>
     <p>four shot made at him, until at length they fetched him; and learned by him, that, not past</p>
     <p>eight days before our arrival, the King had sent thither some 150 soldiers to guard the town</p>
     <p>against the Cimaroons, and the town at this time was full of people beside: which all the</p>
     <p>rather believed, because it agreed with the report of the Negroes, which we took before at</p>
     <p>the Isle of Pinos. And therefore our Captain sent his brother and JOHN OXNAM to</p>
     <p>understand the truth thereof.</p>
     <p>They found our men which we left in our pinnaces much frightened, by reason that they</p>
     <p>saw great troops and companies running up and down, with matches lighted, some with</p>
     <p>other weapons, crying Que gente? que gente? which not having been at the first conflict,</p>
     <p>but coming from the utter ends of the town (being at least as big as Plymouth), came many</p>
     <p>times near us; and understanding that we were English, discharged their pieces and ran</p>
     <p>away.</p>
     <p>Presently after this, a mighty shower of rain, with a terrible storm of thunder and</p>
     <p>lightning, fell, which poured down so vehemently (as it usually doth in those countries)</p>
     <p>that before we could recover the shelter of a certain shade or penthouse at the western</p>
     <p>end of the King's Treasure House, (which seemeth to have been built there of purpose to</p>
     <p>avoid sun and rain) some of our bow-strings were wet, and some of ours match and powder</p>
     <p>hurt! which while we were careful of, to refurnish and supply; divers of our men harping on</p>
     <p>the reports lately brought us, were muttering of the forces of the town, which our Captain</p>
     <p>perceiving, told them, that &quot;He had brought them to the mouth of the Treasure of the</p>
     <p>World, if they would want it, they might henceforth blame nobody but themselves!&quot;</p>
     <p>And therefore as soon as the storm began to assuage of his fury (which was a long half</p>
     <p>hour) willing to give his men no longer leisure to demur of those doubts, nor yet allow the</p>
     <p>enemy farther respite to gather themselves together, he stept forward commanding his</p>
     <p>brother, with JOHN OXNAM and the company appointed them, to break the King's Treasure</p>
     <p>house: the rest to follow him to keep the strength of the Market Place, till they had</p>
     <p>despatched the business for which they came.</p>
     <p>But as he stepped forward, his strength and sight and speech failed him, and he began to</p>
     <p>faint for want of blood, which, as then we perceived, had, in great quantity, issued upon</p>
     <p>the sand, out of a wound received in his leg in the first encounter, whereby though he felt</p>
     <p>some pain, yet (for that he perceived divers of the company, having already gotten many</p>
     <p>good things, to be very ready to take all occasions, of winding themselves out of that</p>
     <p>conceited danger) would he not have it known to any, till this his fainting, against his will,</p>
     <p>bewrayed it: the blood having first filled the very prints which our footsteps made, to the</p>
     <p>greater dismay of all our company, who thought it not credible that one man should be</p>
     <p>able to spare so much blood and live.</p>
     <p>And therefore even they, which were willing to have adventured the most for so fair a</p>
     <p>booty, would in no case hazard their Captain's life; but (having given him somewhat to</p>
     <p>drink wherewith he recovered himself, and having bound his scarf about his leg, for the</p>
     <p>stopping of the blood) entreated him to be content to go with them aboard, there to have</p>
     <p>his wound searched and dressed, and then to return on shore again if he thought good.</p>
     <p>This when they could not persuade him unto (as who knew it to be utterly impossible, at</p>
     <p>least very unlikely, that ever they should, for that time, return again, to recover the state</p>
     <p>in which they now were: and was of opinion, that it were more honourable for himself, to</p>
     <p>jeopard his life for so great a benefit, than to leave off so high an enterprise</p>
     <p>unperformed), they joined altogether and with force mingled with fair entreaty, they bare</p>
     <p>him aboard his pinnace, and so abandoned a most rich spoil for the present, only to</p>
     <p>preserve their Captain's life: and being resolved of him, that while they enjoyed his</p>
     <p>presence, and had him to command them, they might recover wealth sufficient; but if</p>
     <p>once they lost him, they should hardly be able to recover home. No, not with that which</p>
     <p>they had gotten already.</p>
     <p>Thus we embarked by break of the day (29th July), having besides our Captain, many of our</p>
     <p>men wounded, though none slain but one Trumpeter: whereupon though our surgeons were</p>
     <p>busily employed, in providing remedies and salves for their wounds: yet the main care of</p>
     <p>our Captain was respected by all the rest; so that before we departed out of the harbour</p>
     <p>for the more comfort of our company, we took the aforesaid ship of wines without great</p>
     <p>resistance.</p>
     <p>But before we had her free of the haven, they of the town had made means to bring one of</p>
     <p>their culverins, which we had dismounted, so as they made a shot at us, but hindered us</p>
     <p>not from carrying forth the prize to the Isle of Bastimentos, or the Isle of Victuals: which is</p>
     <p>an island that lieth without the bay to the westward, about a league off the town, where</p>
     <p>we stayed the two next days, to cure our wounded men, and refresh ourselves, in the</p>
     <p>goodly gardens which we there found abounding with great store of all dainty roots and</p>
     <p>fruits; besides great plenty of poultry and other fowls, no less strange then delicate.</p>
     <p>Shortly upon our first arrival in this island, the Governor and the rest of his Assistants in</p>
     <p>the town, as we afterwards understood, sent unto our Captain, a proper gentleman, of</p>
     <p>mean stature, good complexion, and a fair spoken, a principal soldier of the late sent</p>
     <p>garrison, to view in what state we were. At his coming he protested &quot;He came to us, of</p>
     <p>mere good will, for that we had attempted so great and incredible a matter with so few</p>
     <p>men: and that, at the first, they feared that we had been French, at whose hands they</p>
     <p>knew they should find no mercy: but after they perceived by our arrows, that we were</p>
     <p>Englishmen, their fears were the less, for that they knew, that though we took the treasure</p>
     <p>of the place, yet we would not use cruelty toward their persons. But albeit this his</p>
     <p>affection gave him cause enough, to come aboard such, whose virtue he so honoured: yet</p>
     <p>the Governor also had not only consented to his coming, but directly sent him, upon</p>
     <p>occasion that divers of the town affirmed, said he, ‘that they knew our Captain, who the</p>
     <p>last two years had been often on our coast, and had always used their persons very well.'</p>
     <p>And therefore desired to know, first, Whether our Captain was the same Captain DRAKE or</p>
     <p>not? and next, Because many of their men were wounded with our arrows, whether they</p>
     <p>were poisoned or not? and how their wounds might best be cured? lastly, What victuals we</p>
     <p>wanted, or other necessaries? of which the Governor promised by him to supply and furnish</p>
     <p>us, as largely as he durst.&quot;</p>
     <p>Our Captain, although he thought this soldier but a spy: yet used him very courteously, and</p>
     <p>answered him to his Governor's demands: that &quot;He was the same DRAKE whom they meant!</p>
     <p>It was never his manner to poison his arrows! They might cure their wounded by ordinary</p>
     <p>surgery! As for wants, he knew the Island of Bastimentos had sufficient, and could furnish</p>
     <p>him if he listed! but he wanted nothing but some of that special commodity which that</p>
     <p>country yielded, to content himself and his company.&quot; And therefore he advised the</p>
     <p>Governor &quot;to hold open his eyes! for before he departed, if GOD lent him life and leave, he</p>
     <p>meant to reap some of their harvest, which they get out of the earth, and send into Spain</p>
     <p>to trouble all the earth!&quot;</p>
     <p>To this answer unlooked for, this gentleman replied, &quot;If he might, without offence, move</p>
     <p>such a question, what should then be the cause of our departing from that town at this</p>
     <p>time, where was above 360 tons of silver ready for the Fleet, and much more gold in value,</p>
     <p>resting in iron chests in the King's Treasure House?&quot;</p>
     <p>But when our Captain had shewed him the true cause of his unwilling retreat aboard, he</p>
     <p>acknowledged that &quot;we had no less reason in departing, than courage in attempting&quot;: and</p>
     <p>no doubt did easily see, that it was not for the town to seek revenge of us, by manning</p>
     <p>forth such frigates or other vessels as they had; but better to content themselves and</p>
     <p>provide for their own defence.</p>
     <p>Thus, with great favour and courteous entertainment, besides such gifts from our Captain</p>
     <p>as most contended him, after dinner, he was in such sort dismissed, to make report of that</p>
     <p>he had seen, that he protested, &quot;he was never so much honoured of any in his life.&quot;</p>
     <p>After his departure, the Negro formentioned, being examined more fully, confirmed this</p>
     <p>report of the gold and the silver; with many other intelligences of importance: especially</p>
     <p>how we might have gold and silver enough, if we would, by means of the Cimaroons, whom</p>
     <p>though he had betrayed divers times (being used thereto by his Masters) so that he knew</p>
     <p>they would kill him, if they got him: yet if our Captain would undertake his protection, he</p>
     <p>durst adventure his life, because he knew our Captain's name was most precious and highly</p>
     <p>honoured by them.</p>
     <p>This report ministered occasion to further consultation: for which, because this place</p>
     <p>seemed not the safest; as being neither the healthiest nor quietest; the next day, in the</p>
     <p>morning, we all set our course for the Isle of Pinos or Port Plenty, where we had left our</p>
     <p>ships, continuing all that day, and the next till towards night, before we recovered it.</p>
     <p>We were the longer in this course, for that our Captain sent away his brother and ELLIS</p>
     <p>HIXOM to the westward, to search the River of Chagres, where himself had been the year</p>
     <p>before, and yet was careful to gain more notice of; it being a river which trendeth to the</p>
     <p>southward, within six leagues of Panama, where is a little town called Venta Cruz [Venta de</p>
     <p>Cruzes], whence all the treasure, that was usually brought thither from Panama by mules,</p>
     <p>was embarked in frigates [sailing] down that river into the North sea, and so to Nombre de</p>
     <p>Dios.</p>
     <p>It ebbeth and floweth not far into the land, and therefore it asketh three days' rowing with</p>
     <p>a fine pinnace to pass [up] from the mouth to Venta Cruz; but one day and a night serveth</p>
     <p>to return down the river.</p>
     <p>At our return to our ships (1st August), in our consultation, Captain RANSE (forecasting</p>
     <p>divers doubts of our safe continuance upon that coast, being now discovered) was willing</p>
     <p>to depart; and our Captain no less willing to dismiss him: and therefore as soon as our</p>
     <p>pinnaces returned from chagres (7th August) with such advertisement as they were sent</p>
     <p>for, about eight days before; Captain RANSE took his leave, leaving us at the isle aforesaid,</p>
     <p>where we had remained five or six days.</p>
     <p>In which meantime, having put all things in a readiness, our Captain resolved, with his two</p>
     <p>ships and three pinnaces to go to Cartagena; whither in sailing, we spent some six days by</p>
     <p>reason of the calms which came often upon us: but all this time we attempted nothing that</p>
     <p>we might have done by the way, neither at [Santiago de] Tolou nor otherwhere, because we</p>
     <p>would not be discovered.</p>
     <p>We came to anchor with our two ships in the evening [13th August], in seven fathom water,</p>
     <p>between the island of Charesha [the island of Cartagena, p. 156] and St. Barnards [San</p>
     <p>Bernardo.]</p>
     <p>Our Captain led the three pinnaces about the island, into the harbour of Cartagena; where</p>
     <p>at the very entry, he found a frigate at anchor, aboard which was only one old man; who</p>
     <p>being demanded, &quot;Where the rest of his company was?&quot; answered, &quot;That they were gone</p>
     <p>ashore in their gundeloe [gondola or ship's boat?], that evening, to fight about a mistress&quot;:</p>
     <p>and voluntarily related to our Captain that, &quot;two hours before night, there past by them a</p>
     <p>pinnace, with sail and oars, as fast as ever they could row, calling to him ‘Whether there</p>
     <p>had not been any English and Frenchmen there lately?' and upon answer that, ‘There had</p>
     <p>been none!' they bid them ‘look to themselves!' That, within an hour that this pinnace was</p>
     <p>come to the utterside [outside] of Cartagena, there were many great pieces shot off,</p>
     <p>whereupon one going to top, to descry what might be the cause? espied, over the land,</p>
     <p>divers frigates and small shipping bringing themselves within the Castle.&quot;</p>
     <p>This report our Captain credited, the rather for that himself had heard the report of the</p>
     <p>ordinance at sea; and perceived sufficiently, that he was now descried. Notwithstanding in</p>
     <p>farther examination of this old mariner, having understood, that there was, within the next</p>
     <p>point, a great ship of Seville, which had here discharged her loading, and rid now with her</p>
     <p>yards across, being bound the next morning for Santo Domingo: our Captain took this old</p>
     <p>man into his pinnace to verify that which he had informed, and rowed towards this ship,</p>
     <p>which as we came near it, hailed us, asking, &quot;Whence our shallops were?&quot;</p>
     <p>We answered, &quot;From Nombre de Dios!&quot;</p>
     <p>Straightway they railed! and reviled! We gave no heed to their words, but every pinnace,</p>
     <p>according to our Captain's order, one on the starboard bow, the other on the starboard</p>
     <p>quarter, and the Captain in the midship on the larboard side, forthwith boarded her;</p>
     <p>though we had some difficulty to enter by reason of her height, being of 240 tons. But as</p>
     <p>soon as we entered upon the decks, we threw down the grates and spardecks, to prevent</p>
     <p>the Spaniards from annoying us with their close fights: who then perceiving that we were</p>
     <p>possessed of their ship, stowed themselves all in hold with their weapons, except two or</p>
     <p>three yonkers, which were found afore the beetes: when having light out of our pinnaces,</p>
     <p>we found no danger of the enemy remaining, we cut their cables at halse, and with our</p>
     <p>three pinnaces, towed her without the island into the sound right afore the town, without</p>
     <p>[beyond the] danger of their great shot.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, the town having intelligence hereof, or by their watch, took the alarm, rang</p>
     <p>out their bells, shot off about thirty pieces of great ordnance, put all their men in a</p>
     <p>readiness, horse and foot, came down to the very point of the wood, and discharged their</p>
     <p>calivers, to impeach us if they might, in going forth.</p>
     <p>The next morning (14th August) our ships took two frigates, in which there were two, who</p>
     <p>called themselves King's Scrivanos, the one of Cartagena, the other of Veragua, with seven</p>
     <p>mariners and two Negroes: who had been at Nombre de Dios and were now bound for</p>
     <p>Cartagena with double [duplicate?] letters of advice, to certify them that Captain DRAKE</p>
     <p>had been at Nombre de Dios, had taken it; and had it not been that he was hurt with some</p>
     <p>blessed shot, by all likelihood he had sacked it. He was yet still upon the coast; they should</p>
     <p>therefore carefully prepare for him!</p>
     <p>After that our Captain had brought all his fleet together, at the Scrivanos' entreaties, he</p>
     <p>was content to do them all favour, in setting them and all their companies on shore; and so</p>
     <p>bare thence with the islands of St. Bernards, about three leagues of the town: where we</p>
     <p>found great store of fish for our refreshing.</p>
     <p>Here, our Captain considering that he was now discovered upon the chiefest places of all</p>
     <p>the coast, and yet not meaning to leave it till he had found the Cimaroons, and &quot;made&quot; his</p>
     <p>voyage, as he had conceived; which would require some length of time, and sure manning</p>
     <p>of his pinnaces: he determined with himself, to burn one of the ships, and make the other</p>
     <p>a Storehouse; that his pinnaces (which could not otherwise) might be thoroughly manned,</p>
     <p>and so he might be able to abide any time.</p>

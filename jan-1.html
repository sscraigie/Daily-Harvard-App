     <p>Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judg’d it would be well not to distract my attention</p>
     <p>by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then</p>
     <p>to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro’ the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some</p>
     <p>might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang’d them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance</p>
     <p>first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was</p>
     <p>to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual</p>
     <p>temptations. This being acquir’d and establish’d, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge</p>
     <p>at the same time that I improv’d in virtue, and considering that in conversation it was obtain’d rather by the use of</p>
     <p>the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and</p>
     <p>joking, which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silence the second place. This and the next, Order,</p>
     <p>I expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once become habitual,</p>
     <p>would keep me firm in my endeavors to obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeing me from my</p>
     <p>remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and</p>
     <p>Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in his Golden Verses, daily</p>
     <p>examination would be necessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination.</p>
     <p>I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues. I rul’d each page with red ink, so as to have</p>
     <p>seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day. I cross’d these columns</p>
     <p>with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line,</p>
     <p>and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been</p>
     <p>committed respecting that virtue upon that day.</p>
     <p>I determined to give a week’s strict attention to each of the virtues successively. Thus, in the first week, my great</p>
     <p>guard was to avoid every the least offence against Temperance, leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance,</p>
     <p>only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear</p>
     <p>of spots, I suppos’d the habit of that virtue so much strengthen’d, and its opposite weaken’d, that I might venture</p>
     <p>extending my attention to include the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding</p>
     <p>thus to the last, I could go thro’ a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who,</p>
     <p>having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and</p>
     <p>his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish’d the first, proceeds to a second, so I</p>
     <p>should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing</p>
     <p>successively my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should he happy in viewing a clean book,</p>
     <p>after a thirteen weeks’ daily examination.</p>
     <p>This my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison’s Cato:</p>
     <p>“Here will I hold. If there’s a power above us</p>
     <p>(And that there is, all nature cries aloud</p>
     <p>Thro’ all her works), He must delight in virtue;</p>
     <p>And that which he delights in must be happy.”</p>
     <p>Another from Cicero,</p>
     <p>“O vitæ Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex præceptis tuis actus,</p>
     <p>peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus.”</p>
     <p>Another from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:</p>
     <p>“Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and</p>
     <p>all her paths are peace.” iii. 16, 17.</p>
     <p>And conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for</p>
     <p>obtaining it; to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefix’d to my tables of examination, for daily</p>
     <p>use.</p>
     <p>“O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest</p>
     <p>interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy other</p>
     <p>children as the only return in my power for thy continual favors to me.”</p>
     <p>I used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson’s Poems, viz.:</p>
     <p>“Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!</p>
     <p>O teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!</p>
     <p>Save me from folly, vanity, and vice,</p>
     <p>From every low pursuit; and fill my soul</p>
     <p>With knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;</p>
     <p>Sacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!”</p>
     <p>The precept of Order requiring that every part of my business should have its allotted time, one page in my little</p>
     <p>book contain’d the following scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural day:</p>
     <p>THE MORNING.</p>
     <p>(5–7)</p>
     <p>Question. What good shall I do this day?</p>
     <p>Rise, wash, and address Powerful Goodness! Contrive day’s business, and take the resolution of the day; prosecute</p>
     <p>the present study, and breakfast.</p>
     <p>(8–11)</p>
     <p>Work.</p>
     <p>NOON.</p>
     <p>(12–1)</p>
     <p>Read, or overlook my accounts, and dine.</p>
     <p>(2–5)</p>
     <p>Work.</p>
     <p>EVENING. (6–9)</p>
     <p>Question. What good have I done to-day?</p>
     <p>Put things in their places. Supper. Music or diversion, or conversation. Examination of the day.</p>
     <p>NIGHT. (10–4)</p>
     <p>Sleep.</p>
     <p>I enter’d upon the execution of this plan for self-examination, and continu’d it with occasional intermissions for some</p>
     <p>time. I was surpris’d to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing</p>
     <p>them diminish. To avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out the marks on</p>
     <p>the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new course, became full of holes, I transferr’d my tables and</p>
     <p>precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines were drawn with red ink, that made a</p>
     <p>durable stain, and on those lines I mark’d my faults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out with</p>
     <p>a wet sponge. After a while I went thro’ one course only in a year, and afterward only one in several years, till at</p>
     <p>length I omitted them entirely, being employ’d in voyages and business abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that</p>
     <p>interfered; but I always carried my little book with me.</p>
     <p>My scheme of ORDER gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho’ it might be practicable where a man’s business</p>
     <p>was such as to leave him the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it was not possible to</p>
     <p>be exactly observed by a master, who must mix with the world, and often receive people of business at their own</p>
     <p>hours. Order, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been</p>
     <p>early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending</p>
     <p>want of method. This article, therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so much,</p>
     <p>and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the</p>
     <p>attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect, like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my</p>
     <p>neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The smith consented to grind it bright for</p>
     <p>him if he would turn the wheel; he turn’d, while the smith press’d the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the</p>
     <p>stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the</p>
     <p>work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was, without farther grinding. “No,” said the smith, “turn on,</p>
     <p>turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled.”</p>
     <p>“Yes,” said the man, “but I think I like a speckled ax best.” And I believe this may have been the case with many,</p>
     <p>who, having, for want of some such means as I employ’d, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad</p>
     <p>habits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that “a speckled ax was best”; for</p>
     <p>something, that pretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as I</p>
     <p>exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a</p>
     <p>perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that a benevolent man</p>
     <p>should allow a few faults in himself, to keep his friends in countenance.</p>
     <p>In truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very</p>
     <p>sensibly the want of it. But, on the whole, tho’ I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining,</p>
     <p>but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I</p>
     <p>had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, tho’ they never reach</p>
     <p>the wish’d-for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavor, and is tolerable while it continues</p>
     <p>fair and legible.</p>
     <p>It may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor</p>
     <p>ow’d the constant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written. What reverses may attend the</p>
     <p>remainder is in the hand of Providence; but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy’d ought to help his</p>
     <p>bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribes his long-continued health, and what is still left to</p>
     <p>him of a good constitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his</p>
     <p>fortune, with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some degree of</p>
     <p>reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country, and the honorable employs it</p>
     <p>conferred upon him; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues, even in the imperfect state he was</p>
     <p>able to acquire them, all that evenness of temper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his company</p>
     <p>still sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance. I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may</p>
     <p>follow the example and reap the benefit.</p>

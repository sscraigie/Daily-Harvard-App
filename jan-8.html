     <p>I</p>
     <p>[1] THERE was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; 1 and that man was perfect and upright, and one that</p>
     <p>feared God, and turned away from evil.</p>
     <p>[2] And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</p>
     <p>[3] His 2 substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and</p>
     <p>five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</p>
     <p>[4] And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three</p>
     <p>sisters to eat and to drink with them.</p>
     <p>[5] And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up</p>
     <p>early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my</p>
     <p>sons have sinned, and renounced 3 God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</p>
     <p>[6] Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan 4</p>
     <p>also came among them.</p>
     <p>[7] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, from going to and fro</p>
     <p>in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
     <p>[8] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for 5 there is none like him in the earth, a</p>
     <p>perfect and upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.</p>
     <p>[9] Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</p>
     <p>[10] Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast</p>
     <p>blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</p>
     <p>[11] But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</p>
     <p>[12] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; 7 only upon himself put not forth thy</p>
     <p>hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</p>
     <p>[13] And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s</p>
     <p>house,</p>
     <p>[14] that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;</p>
     <p>[15] and the 8 Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants 9 with the edge of the</p>
     <p>sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
     <p>[16] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath</p>
     <p>burned up the sheep and the servants, 10 and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
     <p>[17] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell 11 upon</p>
     <p>the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants 12 with the edge of the sword; and I only am</p>
     <p>escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
     <p>[18] While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and</p>
     <p>drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house;</p>
     <p>[19] and, behold, there came a great wind from 13 the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it</p>
     <p>fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</p>
     <p>[20] Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;</p>
     <p>[21] and he said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and</p>
     <p>Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.</p>
     <p>[22] In all this Job sinned not, nor 14 charged God foolishly.</p>
     <p>II</p>
     <p>[1] AGAIN it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan</p>
     <p>came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.</p>
     <p>[2] And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to</p>
     <p>and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
     <p>[3] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for 1 there is none like him in the earth, a</p>
     <p>perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity,</p>
     <p>although thou movedst me against him, to 2 destroy him without cause.</p>
     <p>[4] And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</p>
     <p>[5] But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</p>
     <p>[6] And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.</p>
     <p>[7] So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his</p>
     <p>crown.</p>
     <p>[8] And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.</p>
     <p>[9] Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.</p>
     <p>[10] But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish 3 women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the</p>
     <p>hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</p>
     <p>[11] Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own</p>
     <p>place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment</p>
     <p>together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</p>
     <p>[12] And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they</p>
     <p>rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</p>
     <p>[13] So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for</p>
     <p>they saw that his grief 4 was very great.</p>
     <p>III</p>
     <p>[1] AFTER this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>
     <p>[2] And Job answered and said:</p>
     <p>[3] Let the day perish wherein I was born,</p>
     <p>And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.</p>
     <p>[4] Let that day be darkness;</p>
     <p>Let not God from above seek for it,</p>
     <p>Neither let the light shine upon it.</p>
     <p>[5] Let darkness and the 1 shadow of death claim it for their own;</p>
     <p>Let a cloud dwell upon it;</p>
     <p>Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</p>
     <p>[6] As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it:</p>
     <p>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;</p>
     <p>Let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
     <p>[7] Lo, let that night be barren; 2</p>
     <p>Let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
     <p>[8] Let them curse it that curse the day,</p>
     <p>Who are ready 3 to rouse up leviathan.</p>
     <p>[9] Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark:</p>
     <p>Let it look for light, but have none;</p>
     <p>Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</p>
     <p>[10] Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb,</p>
     <p>Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</p>
     <p>[11] Why died I not from the womb?</p>
     <p>Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?</p>
     <p>[12] Why did the knees receive me?</p>
     <p>Or why the breasts, that I should suck?</p>
     <p>[13] For now should I have lain down and been quiet;</p>
     <p>I should have slept; then had I been at rest,</p>
     <p>[14] With kings and counsellors of the earth,</p>
     <p>Who built 4 up waste places for themselves;</p>
     <p>[15] Or with princes that had gold,</p>
     <p>Who filled their houses with silver:</p>
     <p>[16] Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,</p>
     <p>As infants that never saw light.</p>
     <p>[17] There the wicked cease from troubling; 5</p>
     <p>And there the weary are at rest,</p>
     <p>[18] There the prisoners are at ease together;</p>
     <p>They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</p>
     <p>[19] The small and the great are there:</p>
     <p>And the servant is free from his master.</p>
     <p>[20] Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,</p>
     <p>And life unto the bitter in soul;</p>
     <p>[21] Who long 6 for death, but it cometh not,</p>
     <p>And dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>
     <p>[22] Who rejoice exceedingly, 7</p>
     <p>And are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
     <p>[23] Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,</p>
     <p>And whom God hath hedged in?</p>
     <p>[24] For my sighing cometh before 8 I eat,</p>
     <p>And my groanings 9 are poured out like water.</p>
     <p>[25] For the 10 thing which I fear cometh upon me,</p>
     <p>And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.</p>
     <p>[26] I am 11 not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;</p>
     <p>But trouble cometh.</p>
     <p>IV</p>
     <p>[1] THEN answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p>
     <p>[2] If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?</p>
     <p>But who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
     <p>[3] Behold, thou hast instructed many,</p>
     <p>And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>
     <p>[4] Thy words have upholden him that was falling,</p>
     <p>And thou hast made firm the feeble 1 knees.</p>
     <p>[5] But now it is come unto thee, and thou 2 faintest;</p>
     <p>It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
     <p>[6] Is not thy fear of God thy confidence,</p>
     <p>And the integrity of thy ways thy hope?</p>
     <p>[7] Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?</p>
     <p>Or where were the upright cut off?</p>
     <p>[8] According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,</p>
     <p>And sow trouble, 3 reap the same.</p>
     <p>[9] By the breath of God they perish,</p>
     <p>And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.</p>
     <p>[10] The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,</p>
     <p>And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>
     <p>[11] The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,</p>
     <p>And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</p>
     <p>[12] Now a thing was secretly 4 brought to me,</p>
     <p>And mine ear received a whisper thereof.</p>
     <p>[13] In thoughts from the visions of the night,</p>
     <p>When deep sleep falleth on men,</p>
     <p>[14] Fear came upon me, and trembling,</p>
     <p>Which made all my bones to shake.</p>
     <p>[15] Then a 5 spirit passed before my face;</p>
     <p>The hair of my flesh stood up.</p>
     <p>[16] It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof;</p>
     <p>A form was before mine eyes:</p>
     <p>There 6 was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</p>
     <p>[17] Shall mortal man be 7 more just than God?</p>
     <p>Shall a man be 8 more pure than his Maker?</p>
     <p>[18] Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants;</p>
     <p>And his angels he chargeth with folly:</p>
     <p>[19] How much more them that dwell in houses of clay,</p>
     <p>Whose foundation is in the dust,</p>
     <p>Who are crushed before 9 the moth!</p>
     <p>[20] Betwixt 10 morning and evening they are destroyed: 11</p>
     <p>They perish for ever without any regarding it.</p>
     <p>[21] Is 12 not their tent-cord plucked up within them?</p>
     <p>They die, and that without wisdom.</p>
     <p>V</p>
     <p>[1] CALL now; is there any that will answer thee?</p>
     <p>And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</p>
     <p>[2] For vexation killeth the foolish man,</p>
     <p>And jealousy 1 slayeth the silly one.</p>
     <p>[3] I have seen the foolish taking root:</p>
     <p>But suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p>
     <p>[4] His children are far from safety,</p>
     <p>And they are crushed in the gate,</p>
     <p>Neither is there any to deliver them:</p>
     <p>[5] Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,</p>
     <p>And taketh it even out of the thorns;</p>
     <p>And the 2 snare gapeth for their substance.</p>
     <p>[6] For affliction 3 cometh not forth from the dust,</p>
     <p>Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</p>
     <p>[7] But man is born unto trouble,</p>
     <p>As the 4 sparks fly upward.</p>
     <p>[8] But as for me, I would seek unto God,</p>
     <p>And unto God would I commit my cause;</p>
     <p>[9] Who doeth great things and unsearchable,</p>
     <p>Marvellous things without number:</p>
     <p>[10] Who giveth rain upon the earth,</p>
     <p>And sendeth waters upon the fields;</p>
     <p>[11] So that he setteth up on high those that are low,</p>
     <p>And those that mourn are exalted to safety.</p>
     <p>[12] He frustrateth the devices of the crafty,</p>
     <p>[13] He taketh the wise in their own craftiness;</p>
     <p>And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</p>
     <p>[14] They meet with darkness in the day-time,</p>
     <p>And grope at noonday as in the night.</p>
     <p>[15] But he saveth from the sword of 6 their mouth,</p>
     <p>Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</p>
     <p>[16] So the poor hath hope,</p>
     <p>And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p>
     <p>[17] Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: 7</p>
     <p>Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.</p>
     <p>[18] For he maketh sore, and bindeth up;</p>
     <p>He woundeth, and his hands make whole.</p>
     <p>[19] He will deliver thee in six troubles;</p>
     <p>Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</p>
     <p>[20] In famine he will redeem thee from death;</p>
     <p>And in war from the power of the sword.</p>
     <p>[21] Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue;</p>
     <p>Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p>
     <p>[22] At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh;</p>
     <p>Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>
     <p>[23] For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;</p>
     <p>And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</p>
     <p>[24] And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace;</p>
     <p>And thou shalt visit thy fold, 8 and shalt 9 miss nothing.</p>
     <p>[25] Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,</p>
     <p>And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</p>
     <p>[26] Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,</p>
     <p>Like as a shock of grain cometh in its season.</p>
     <p>[27] Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;</p>
     <p>Hear it, and know thou it for 10 thy good.</p>
     <p>VI</p>
     <p>[1] THEN Job answered and said,</p>
     <p>[2] Oh that my vexation were but weighed,</p>
     <p>And all my calamity laid in the balances!</p>
     <p>[3] For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas:</p>
     <p>Therefore have my words been rash.</p>
     <p>[4] For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,</p>
     <p>The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up:</p>
     <p>The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</p>
     <p>[5] Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?</p>
     <p>Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>
     <p>[6] Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt?</p>
     <p>Or is there any taste in the 1 white of an egg?</p>
     <p>[7] My 2 soul refuseth to touch them;</p>
     <p>They are as loathsome food to me.</p>
     <p>[8] Oh that I might have my request;</p>
     <p>And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</p>
     <p>[9] Even that it would please God to crush me;</p>
     <p>That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>
     <p>[10] And be it still my consolation,</p>
     <p>Yea, 3 let me exult 4 in pain that 5 spareth not,</p>
     <p>That I have not denied 6 the words of the Holy One.</p>
     <p>[11] What is my strength, that I should wait?</p>
     <p>And what is mine end, that I should be patient?</p>
     <p>[12] Is my strength the strength of stones?</p>
     <p>Or is my flesh of brass?</p>
     <p>[13] Is it not that I have no help in me,</p>
     <p>And that wisdom is driven quite from me?</p>
     <p>[14] To him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend;</p>
     <p>Even 7 to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>
     <p>[15] My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook,</p>
     <p>As the channel of brooks that pass away;</p>
     <p>[16] Which are black by reason of the ice,</p>
     <p>And wherein the snow hideth itself:</p>
     <p>[17] What time they wax 8 warm, they vanish;</p>
     <p>When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
     <p>[18] The 9 caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside;</p>
     <p>They go up into the waste, and perish.</p>
     <p>[19] The caravans of Tema looked,</p>
     <p>The companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>
     <p>[20] They were put to shame because they had hoped;</p>
     <p>They came thither, and were confounded.</p>
     <p>[21] For now ye are 10 nothing;</p>
     <p>Ye see a terror, and are afraid.</p>
     <p>[22] Did I say, Give unto me?</p>
     <p>Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?</p>
     <p>[23] Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?</p>
     <p>Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?</p>
     <p>[24] Teach me, and I will hold my peace;</p>
     <p>And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
     <p>[25] How forcible are words of uprightness!</p>
     <p>But your reproof, what doth it reprove?</p>
     <p>[26] Do ye think to reprove words,</p>
     <p>Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as 11 wind?</p>
     <p>[27] Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless,</p>
     <p>And make merchandise of your friend.</p>
     <p>[28] Now therefore be pleased to look upon me;</p>
     <p>For 12 surely I shall not lie to your face.</p>
     <p>[29] Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice;</p>
     <p>Yea, return again, my 13 cause is righteous.</p>
     <p>[30] Is there injustice on my tongue?</p>
     <p>Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?</p>
     <p>VII</p>
     <p>[1] IS there not a warfare 1 to man upon earth?</p>
     <p>And are not his days like the days of a hireling?</p>
     <p>[2] As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow,</p>
     <p>And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:</p>
     <p>[3] So am I made to possess months of misery,</p>
     <p>And wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>
     <p>[4] When I lie down, I say,</p>
     <p>When shall I arise, and the night be gone?</p>
     <p>And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</p>
     <p>[5] My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;</p>
     <p>My skin closeth 2 up, and breaketh out afresh.</p>
     <p>[6] My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,</p>
     <p>And are spent without hope.</p>
     <p>[7] Oh remember that my life is a breath:</p>
     <p>Mine eye shall no more see good.</p>
     <p>[8] The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more;</p>
     <p>Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.</p>
     <p>[9] As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away,</p>
     <p>So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.</p>
     <p>[10] He shall return no more to his house,</p>
     <p>Neither shall his place know him any more.</p>
     <p>[11] Therefore I will not refrain my mouth:</p>
     <p>I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;</p>
     <p>I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
     <p>[12] Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,</p>
     <p>That thou settest a watch over me?</p>
     <p>[13] When I say, My bed shall comfort me,</p>
     <p>My couch shall ease my complaint;</p>
     <p>[14] Then thou scarest me with dreams,</p>
     <p>And terrifiest me through visions:</p>
     <p>[15] So that my soul chooseth strangling,</p>
     <p>And death rather than these my bones.</p>
     <p>[16] I 3 loathe my life; I would 4 not live alway:</p>
     <p>Let me alone; for my days are vanity. 5</p>
     <p>[17] What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him,</p>
     <p>And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,</p>
     <p>[18] And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,</p>
     <p>And try him every moment?</p>
     <p>[19] How long wilt thou not look away from me,</p>
     <p>Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</p>
     <p>[20] If I have sinned, what do 6 I unto thee, O thou watcher 7 of men?</p>
     <p>Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee,</p>
     <p>So that I am a burden to myself?</p>
     <p>[21] And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?</p>
     <p>For now shall I lie down in the dust;</p>
     <p>And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.</p>
     <p>VIII</p>
     <p>[1] THEN answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>
     <p>[2] How long wilt thou speak these things?</p>
     <p>And how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind?</p>
     <p>[3] Doth God pervert justice?</p>
     <p>Or doth the Almighty pervert righteousness?</p>
     <p>[4] If 1 thy children have sinned against him,</p>
     <p>And he hath delivered them into the hand of their transgression;</p>
     <p>[5] If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God,</p>
     <p>And make thy supplication to the Almighty;</p>
     <p>[6] If thou wert pure and upright:</p>
     <p>Surely now he would awake for thee,</p>
     <p>And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</p>
     <p>[7] And though thy beginning was small,</p>
     <p>Yet thy latter end would greatly increase.</p>
     <p>[8] For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age,</p>
     <p>And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out</p>
     <p>[9] (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing,</p>
     <p>Because our days upon earth are a shadow);</p>
     <p>[10] Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee,</p>
     <p>And utter words out of their heart?</p>
     <p>[11] Can the rush 2 grow up without mire?</p>
     <p>Can the flag 3 grow without water?</p>
     <p>[12] Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down,</p>
     <p>It withereth before any other herb.</p>
     <p>[13] So are the paths of all that forget God;</p>
     <p>And the hope of the godless man shall perish:</p>
     <p>[14] Whose confidence shall break 4 in sunder,</p>
     <p>And whose trust is a spider’s web. 5</p>
     <p>[15] He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand:</p>
     <p>He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.</p>
     <p>[16] He is green before the sun,</p>
     <p>And his shoots go forth over his garden.</p>
     <p>[17] His roots are wrapped about 6 the stone-heap,</p>
     <p>He beholdeth the place of stones.</p>
     <p>[18] If he be destroyed from his place,</p>
     <p>Then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</p>
     <p>[19] Behold, this is the joy of his way;</p>
     <p>And out of the earth 7 shall others spring.</p>
     <p>[20] Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man,</p>
     <p>Neither will he uphold the evil-doers.</p>
     <p>[21] He 8 will yet fill thy mouth with laughter,</p>
     <p>And thy lips with shouting.</p>
     <p>[22] They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame;</p>
     <p>And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.</p>
     <p>IX</p>
     <p>[1] THEN Job answered and said,</p>
     <p>[2] Of a truth I know that it is so:</p>
     <p>But 1 how can man be just with 2 God?</p>
     <p>[3] If 3 he be pleased to contend with him,</p>
     <p>He cannot answer him one of a thousand.</p>
     <p>[4] He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:</p>
     <p>Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?—</p>
     <p>[5] Him that removeth the mountains, and they know it not,</p>
     <p>When he overturneth them in his anger;</p>
     <p>[6] That shaketh the earth out of its place,</p>
     <p>And the pillars thereof tremble;</p>
     <p>[7] That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not,</p>
     <p>And sealeth up the stars;</p>
     <p>[8] That alone stretcheth out the heavens,</p>
     <p>And treadeth upon the waves 4 of the sea;</p>
     <p>[9] That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,</p>
     <p>And the chambers of the south;</p>
     <p>[10] That doeth great things past finding out,</p>
     <p>Yea, marvellous things without number.</p>
     <p>[11] Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:</p>
     <p>He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</p>
     <p>[12] Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder 5 him?</p>
     <p>Who will say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
     <p>[13] God will not withdraw his anger;</p>
     <p>The helpers of Rahab 6 do 7 stoop under him.</p>
     <p>[14] How much less shall I answer him,</p>
     <p>And choose out my words to reason with him?</p>
     <p>[15] Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer;</p>
     <p>I would make supplication to my judge.</p>
     <p>[16] If I had called, and he had answered me,</p>
     <p>Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.</p>
     <p>[17] For 8 he breaketh me with a tempest,</p>
     <p>And multiplieth my wounds without cause.</p>
     <p>[18] He will not suffer me to take my breath,</p>
     <p>But filleth me with bitterness.</p>
     <p>[19] If we speak of strength, lo, 9 he is mighty!</p>
     <p>And if of justice, Who, saith he, will summon me?</p>
     <p>[20] Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me:</p>
     <p>Though I be perfect, it 10 shall prove me perverse.</p>
     <p>[21] I 11 am perfect; I regard not myself;</p>
     <p>I despise my life.</p>
     <p>[22] It is all one; therefore I say,</p>
     <p>He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</p>
     <p>[23] If the scourge slay suddenly,</p>
     <p>He will mock at the trial 12 of the innocent.</p>
     <p>[24] The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;</p>
     <p>He covereth the faces of the judges thereof:</p>
     <p>If it be not he, who then is it?</p>
     <p>[25] Now my days are swifter than a post: 13</p>
     <p>They flee away, they see no good.</p>
     <p>[26] They are passed away as the swift 14 ships;</p>
     <p>As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.</p>
     <p>[27] If I say, I will forget my complaint,</p>
     <p>I will put off my sad countenance, and be 15 of good cheer;</p>
     <p>[28] I am afraid of all my sorrows,</p>
     <p>I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</p>
     <p>[29] I shall be condemned;</p>
     <p>Why then do I labor in vain?</p>
     <p>[30] If I wash myself with 16 snow water,</p>
     <p>And make 17 my hands never so clean;</p>
     <p>[31] Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch,</p>
     <p>And mine own clothes shall abhor me.</p>
     <p>[32] For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,</p>
     <p>That we should come together in judgment.</p>
     <p>[33] There is no umpire betwixt us,</p>
     <p>That might lay his hand upon us both.</p>
     <p>[34] Let him take his rod away from me,</p>
     <p>And let not his terror make me afraid:</p>
     <p>[35] Then would I speak, and not fear him;</p>
     <p>For I am not so in myself.</p>
     <p>X</p>
     <p>[1] MY soul is weary of my life;</p>
     <p>I will give free course to my complaint;</p>
     <p>I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
     <p>[2] I will say unto God, Do not condemn me;</p>
     <p>Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.</p>
     <p>[3] Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress,</p>
     <p>That thou shouldest despise the work 1 of thy hands,</p>
     <p>And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</p>
     <p>[4] Hast thou eyes of flesh?</p>
     <p>Or seest thou as man seeth?</p>
     <p>[5] Are thy days as the days of man,</p>
     <p>Or thy years as man’s days,</p>
     <p>[6] That thou inquirest after mine iniquity,</p>
     <p>And searchest after my sin,</p>
     <p>[7] Although thou knowest that I am not wicked,</p>
     <p>And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?</p>
     <p>[8] Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me</p>
     <p>Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</p>
     <p>[9] Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay;</p>
     <p>And wilt thou bring me into dust again?</p>
     <p>[10] Hast thou not poured me out as milk,</p>
     <p>And curdled me like cheese?</p>
     <p>[11] Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,</p>
     <p>And knit me together with bones and sinews.</p>
     <p>[12] Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness;</p>
     <p>And thy visitation 2 hath preserved my spirit.</p>
     <p>[13] Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart;</p>
     <p>I know that this is with thee:</p>
     <p>[14] If I sin, then thou markest me,</p>
     <p>And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</p>
     <p>[15] If I be wicked, woe unto me;</p>
     <p>And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head</p>
     <p>Being 3 filled with ignominy,</p>
     <p>And looking upon mine affliction.</p>
     <p>[16] And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion;</p>
     <p>And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me.</p>
     <p>[17] Thou renewest thy witnesses against me,</p>
     <p>And increasest thine indignation upon me:</p>
     <p>Changes 4 and warfare are with me.</p>
     <p>[18] Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?</p>
     <p>I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.</p>
     <p>[19] I should have been as though I had not been;</p>
     <p>I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
     <p>[20] Are not my days few? cease 5 then,</p>
     <p>And let me alone, that I may take 6 comfort a little,</p>
     <p>[21] Before I go whence I shall not return,</p>
     <p>Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;</p>
     <p>[22] The land dark as midnight, 7</p>
     <p>The land of the shadow of death, without any order,</p>
     <p>And where the light is as midnight. 7</p>

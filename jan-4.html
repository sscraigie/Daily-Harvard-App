     <p>THERE was once upon a time a Fisherman who lived with his wife in a miserable hovel close by the sea, and every day</p>
     <p>he went out fishing. And once as he was sitting with his rod, looking at the clear water, his line suddenly went down,</p>
     <p>far down below, and when he drew it up again, he brought out a large Flounder. Then the Flounder said to him,</p>
     <p>“Hark, you Fisherman, I pray you, let me live, I am no Flounder really, but an enchanted prince. What good will it do</p>
     <p>you kill me? I should not be good to eat, put me in the water again, and let me go.” “Come,” said the Fisherman,</p>
     <p>“there is no need for so many words about it—a fish that can talk I should certainly let go, anyhow,” with that he put</p>
     <p>him back again into the clear water, and the Flounder went to the bottom, leaving a long streak of blood behind him.</p>
     <p>Then the Fisherman got up and went home to his wife in the hovel.</p>
     <p>“Husband,” said the woman, “have you caught nothing to-day?” “No,” said the man, “I did catch a Flounder, who said</p>
     <p>he was an enchanted prince, so I let him go again.” “Did you not wish for anything first.” said the woman. “No,” said</p>
     <p>the man; “what should I wish for?” “Ah,” said the woman, “it is surely hard to have to live always in this dirty hovel;</p>
     <p>you might have wished for a small cottage for us. Go back and call him. Tell him we want to have a small cottage, he</p>
     <p>will certainly give us that.” “Ah,” said the man, “why should I go there again?” “Why,” said the woman, “you did</p>
     <p>catch him, and you let him go again; he is sure to do it. Go at once.” The man still did not quite like to go, but did</p>
     <p>not like to oppose his wife, and went to the sea.</p>
     <p>When he got there the sea was all green and yellow, and no longer so smooth; so he stood and said,</p>
     <p>“Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
     <p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>
     <p>For my wife, good Ilsabil, 2</p>
     <p>Wills not as I’d have her will.”</p>
     <p>Then the Flounder came swimming to him and said, “Well, what does she want, then?” “Ah,” said the man, “I did</p>
     <p>catch you, and my wife says I really ought to have wished for something. She does not like to live in a wretched hovel</p>
     <p>any longer; she would like to have a cottage.” “Go, then,” said the Flounder, “she has it already.”</p>
     <p>When the man went home, his wife was no longer in the hovel, but instead of it there stood a small cottage, and she</p>
     <p>was sitting on a bench before the door. Then she took him by the hand and said to him. “Just come inside, look, now</p>
     <p>isn’t this a great deal better?” So they went in, and there was a small porch, and a pretty little parlour and bedroom,</p>
     <p>and a kitchen and pantry, with the best of furniture, and fitted up with the most beautiful things made of tin</p>
     <p>and brass, whatsoever was wanted. And behind the cottage there was a small yard, with hens and ducks, and little</p>
     <p>garden with flowers and fruit. “Look,” said the wife, “is not that nice!” “Yes,” said the husband, “and so we must</p>
     <p>always think it,—now we will live quite contended.” “We will think about that,” said the wife. With that they ate</p>
     <p>something and went to bed.</p>
     <p>Everything went well for a week or a fortnight, and then the woman said, “Hark you, husband, this cottage is far too</p>
     <p>small for us, and the garden and yard are little; the Flounder might just as well have given us a larger house. I should</p>
     <p>like to live in a great stone castle; go to the Flounder, and tell him to give us a castle.” “Ah, wife,” said the man,</p>
     <p>“the cottage is quite good enough; why should we live in a castle?” “What!” said the woman; “just go there, the</p>
     <p>Flounder can always do that.” “No, wife,” said the man, “the Flounder has just given us the cottage, I do not like to</p>
     <p>go back so soon, it might make him angry.” “Go,” said the woman, “he can do it quite easily, and will be glad to do</p>
     <p>it; just you go to him.”</p>
     <p>The man’s heart grew heavy, and he would not go. He said to himself, “It is not right,” and yet he went. And when he</p>
     <p>came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark-blue, and grey and thick, and no longer so green and yellow, but</p>
     <p>it was still quiet. And he stood there and said—</p>
     <p>“Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
     <p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>
     <p>For my wife, good Ilsabil,</p>
     <p>Wills not as I’d have her will.”</p>
     <p>“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder. “Alas,” said the man, half scared, “she wants to live in a great</p>
     <p>stone castle.” “Go to it, then, she is standing before the door,” said the Flounder.</p>
     <p>Then the man went away, intending to go home, but when he got there, he found a great stone palace, and his wife</p>
     <p>was just standing on the steps going in, and she took him by the hand and said, “Come in.” So he went in with her,</p>
     <p>and in the castle was a great hall paved with marble, and many servants, who flung wide the doors; and the walls</p>
     <p>were all bright with beautiful hangings, and in the rooms were chairs and tables of pure gold, and crystal chandeliers</p>
     <p>hung from the ceilings, and all the rooms and bed-rooms had carpets, and food and wine of the very best were</p>
     <p>standing on all the tables so that they nearly broke down beneath it. Behind the house, too, there was a great court</p>
     <p>yard, with stables for horses and cows, and the very best of carriages; there was a magnificent large garden, too,</p>
     <p>with the most beautiful flowers and fruit-trees, and a park quite half a mile long, in which were stags, deer, and</p>
     <p>hares, and everything that could be desired. “Come,” said the woman, “isn’t that beautiful?” “Yes, indeed,” said the</p>
     <p>man, “now let it be; and we will live in this beautiful castle and be content.” “We will consider about that,” said the</p>
     <p>woman, “and sleep upon it”; thereupon they went to bed.</p>
     <p>Next morning the wife awoke first, and it was just daybreak, and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying</p>
     <p>before her. Her husband was still stretching himself, so she poked him in the side with her elbow, and said, “Get up,</p>
     <p>husband, and just peep out of the window. Look you, couldn’t we be the King over all that land.? Go to the Flounder,</p>
     <p>we will be the King.” “Ah, wife,” said the man, “why should we be King” I do not want to be King.” “Well,” said the</p>
     <p>wife, “if you won’t be King, I will; go to the Flounder, for I will be King.” “Ah, wife,” said the man, “why do you want</p>
     <p>to be King? I do not like to say that to him.” “Why not?” said the woman; “go to him this instant; I must be King!” So</p>
     <p>the man went, and was quite unhappy because his wife wished to be King. “It is not right; it is not right,” though the.</p>
     <p>He did not wish to go, but yet he went.</p>
     <p>And when he came to the sea, it was quite dark-grey, and the water heaved up from below, and smelt putrid. Then he</p>
     <p>went and stood by it, and said,</p>
     <p>“Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
     <p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>
     <p>For my wife, good Ilsabil,</p>
     <p>Wills not as I’d have her will.”</p>
     <p>“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder. “Alas!” said the man, “she wants to be King.” “Go to her; she is</p>
     <p>King already.”</p>
     <p>So the man went, and when he came to the palace, the castle had become much larger, and had a great tower and</p>
     <p>magnificent ornaments, and the sentinel was standing before the door, and there were numbers of soldiers with</p>
     <p>kettle-drums and trumpets. And when he went inside the house, everything was of real marble and gold, with velvet</p>
     <p>covers and great golden tassels. Then the doors of the hall were opened, and there was the court in all its splendour,</p>
     <p>and his wife was sitting on a high throne of gold and diamonds, with a great crown of gold on her head, and a sceptre</p>
     <p>of pure gold and jewels in her hand, and on both sides of her stood her maids-in-waiting in a row, each of them</p>
     <p>always one head shorter than the last.</p>
     <p>Then he went and stood before her, and said, “Ah, wife, and now you are King.” “Yes,” said the woman, “now I am</p>
     <p>King.” So he stood and looked at her, and when he had looked at her thus for some time, he said, “And now that you</p>
     <p>are King, let all else be, now we will wish for nothing more.” “Nay, husband,” said the woman, quite anxiously, “I find</p>
     <p>time pass very heavily, I can bear it no longer; go to the Flounder—I am King, but I must be Emperor, too.” “Alas,</p>
     <p>wife, why do you wish to be Emperor?” “Husband,” said she, “go to the Flounder. I will be Emperor.” “Alas, wife,”</p>
     <p>said the man, “he cannot make you Emperor: I may not say that to the fish. There is only one Emperor in the land. An</p>
     <p>Emperor the Flounder cannot make you! I assure you he cannot.”</p>
     <p>“What!” said the woman, “I am the King, and you are nothing but my husband; will you go this moment? go at once! If</p>
     <p>he can make a king he can make an emperor. I will be Emperor; go instantly.” So he was forced to go. As the man</p>
     <p>went, however, he was troubled in mind, and thought to himself, “It will not end well; it will not end well! Emperor is</p>
     <p>too shameless! The Flounder will at last be tired out.”</p>
     <p>With that he reached the sea, and the sea was quite black and thick, and began to boil up from below, so that it</p>
     <p>threw up bubbles, and such a sharp wind blew over it that it curled, and the man was afraid. Then he went and stood</p>
     <p>by it, and said,</p>
     <p>“Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
     <p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>
     <p>For my wife, good Ilsabil,</p>
     <p>Wills not as I’d have her will.”</p>
     <p>“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder. “Alas, Flounder,” said he, “my wife wants to be Emperor.” “Go</p>
     <p>to her,” said the Flounder; “she is Emperor already.”</p>
     <p>So the man went, and when he got there the whole palace was made of polished marble with alabaster figures and</p>
     <p>golden ornaments, and soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets, and beating cymbals and drums;</p>
     <p>and in the house, barons, and counts, and dukes were going about as servants. Then they opened the doors to him,</p>
     <p>which were of pure gold. And when he entered, there sat his wife on a throne, which was made of one piece of gold,</p>
     <p>and was quite two miles high; and she wore a great golden crown that was three yards high, and set with diamonds</p>
     <p>and carbuncles, and in one hand she had the sceptre, and in the other the imperial orb; and on both sides of her</p>
     <p>stood the yeomen of the guard in two rows, each being smaller than the one before him, from the biggest giant, who</p>
     <p>was two miles high, to the very smallest dwarf, just as big as my little finger. And before it stood a number of princes</p>
     <p>and dukes.</p>
     <p>Then the man went and stood among them, and said, “Wife, are you Emperor now?” “Yes,” said she, “now I am</p>
     <p>Emperor.” Then he stood and looked at her well, and when he had looked at her thus for some time, he said, “Ah,</p>
     <p>wife, be content, now that you are Emperor.” “Husband,” said she, “why are you standing there? Now, I am Emperor,</p>
     <p>but I will be Pope too; go to the Flounder.” “Alas, wife,” said the man, “what will you not wish for? You cannot be</p>
     <p>Pope; there is but one in Christendom; he cannot make you Pope.” “Husband,” said she, “I will be Pope; go</p>
     <p>immediately, I must be Pope this very day.” “No, wife,” said the man, “I do not like to say that to him; that would not</p>
     <p>do, it is too much; the Flounder can’t make you Pope.” “Husband,” said she, “what nonsense! if he can make an</p>
     <p>emperor he can make a pope. Go to him directly. I am Emperor, 2nd you are nothing but my husband; will you go at</p>
     <p>once?”</p>
     <p>Then he was afraid and went; but he was quite faint, and shivered and shook, and his knees and legs trembled. And a</p>
     <p>high wind blew over the land, and the clouds flew, and towards evening all grew dark, and the leaves fell from the</p>
     <p>trees, and the water rose and roared as if it were boiling, and splashed upon the shore; and in the distance he saw</p>
     <p>ships which were firing guns in their sore need, pitching and tossing on the waves. And yet in the midst of the sky</p>
     <p>there was still a small bit of blue, though on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm. So, full of despair, he went</p>
     <p>and stood in much fear and said,</p>
     <p>“Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
     <p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>
     <p>For my wife, good Ilsabil,</p>
     <p>Wills not as I’d have her will.”</p>
     <p>“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder. “Alas,” said the man, “she wants to be Pope.” “Go to her</p>
     <p>then,” said the Flounder; “she is Pope already.”</p>
     <p>So he went, and when he got there, he saw what seemed to be a large church surrounded by palaces. He pushed his</p>
     <p>way through the crowd. Inside, however, everything was lighted up with thousands and thousands of candles, and his</p>
     <p>wife was clad in gold, and she was sitting on a much higher throne, and had three great golden crowns on, and round</p>
     <p>about her there was much ecclesiastical splendour; and on both sides of her was a row of candles the largest of which</p>
     <p>was as tall as the very tallest tower, down to the very smallest kitchen candle, and all the emperors and kings were</p>
     <p>on their knees before her, kissing her shoe. “Wife,” said the man, and looked attentively at her, “are you now Pope?”</p>
     <p>“Yes,” said she, “I am Pope.” So he stood and looked at her, and it was just as if he was looking at the bright sun.</p>
     <p>When he had stood looking at her thus for a short time, he said, “Ah, wife, if you are Pope, do let well alone!” But</p>
     <p>she looked as stiff as a post, and did not move or show any signs of life. Then said he, “Wife, now that you are Pope,</p>
     <p>be satisfied, you cannot become anything greater now.” “I will consider about that,” said the woman. Thereupon they</p>
     <p>both went to bed, but she was not satisfied, and greediness let her have no sleep, for she was continually thinking</p>
     <p>what there was left for her to be.</p>
     <p>The man slept well and soundly, for he had run about a great deal during the day; but the woman could not fall</p>
     <p>asleep at all, and flung herself from one side to the other the whole night through, thinking always what more was</p>
     <p>left for her to be, but unable to call to mind anything else. At length the sun began to rise, and when the woman saw</p>
     <p>the red of dawn, she sat up in bed and looked at it. And when, through the window, she saw the sun thus rising, she</p>
     <p>said, “Cannot I, too, order the sun and moon to rise?” “Husband,” said she, poking him in the ribs with her elbows,</p>
     <p>“wake up! go to the Flounder, for I wish to be even as God is.” The man was still half asleep, but he was so horrified</p>
     <p>that he fell out of bed. He thought he must have heard amiss, and rubbed his eyes, and said, “Alas, wife, what are</p>
     <p>you saying?” “Husband,” said she, “if I can’t order the sun and moon to rise, and have to look on and see the sun and</p>
     <p>moon rising, I can’t bear it. I shall not know what it is to have another happy hour, unless I can make them rise</p>
     <p>myself.” Then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder ran over him, and said, “Go at once; I wish to be like unto</p>
     <p>God.” “Alas, wife,” said the man, falling on his knees before her, “the Flounder cannot do that; he can make an</p>
     <p>emperor and a pope; I beseech you, go on as you are, and be Pope.” Then she fell into a rage, and her hair flew</p>
     <p>wildly about her head, and she cried, “I will not endure this, I’ll not bear it any longer; wilt thou go?” Then he put on</p>
     <p>his trousers and ran away like a madman. But outside a great storm was raging, and blowing so hard that he could</p>
     <p>scarcely keep his feet; houses and trees toppled over, the mountains trembled, rocks rolled into the sea, the sky was</p>
     <p>pitch black, and it thundered and lightened, and the sea came in with black waves as high as church-towers and</p>
     <p>mountains, and all with crests of white foam at the top. Then he cried, but could not hear his own words,</p>
     <p>“Flounder, flounder in the sea,</p>
     <p>Come, I pray thee, here to me;</p>
     <p>For my wife, good Ilsabil,</p>
     <p>Wills not as I’d have her will.”</p>
     <p>“Well, what does she want, then?” said the Flounder. “Alas,” said he, “she wants to be like unto God.” “Go to her,</p>
     <p>and you will find her back again in the dirty hovel.” And there they are living still at this very time.</p>

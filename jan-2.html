     <p>ON THE MORNING OF CHRIST'S NATIVITY</p>
     <p>(1629)</p>
     <p>I</p>
     <p>THIS is the month, and this the happy morn,</p>
     <p>Wherein the Son of Heaven’s eternal King,</p>
     <p>Of wedded maid and Virgin Mother born,</p>
     <p>Our great redemption from above did bring;</p>
     <p>For so the holy sages once did sing,</p>
     <p>That he our deadly forfeit should release,</p>
     <p>And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.</p>
     <p>II</p>
     <p>That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,</p>
     <p>And that far-beaming blaze of majesty,</p>
     <p>Wherewith he wont at Heaven’s high council-table</p>
     <p>To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,</p>
     <p>He laid aside, and, here with us to be,</p>
     <p>Forsook the Courts of everlasting Day,</p>
     <p>And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay.</p>
     <p>Say, Heavenly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein</p>
     <p>Afford a present to the Infant God?</p>
     <p>Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain,</p>
     <p>To welcome him to this his new abode,</p>
     <p>Now while the heaven, by the Sun’s team untrod,</p>
     <p>Hath took no print of the approaching light,</p>
     <p>And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?</p>
     <p>IV</p>
     <p>See how from far upon the Eastern road</p>
     <p>The star-led Wisards haste with odours sweet!</p>
     <p>Oh! run; prevent them with thy humble ode,</p>
     <p>And lay it lowly at his blessèd feet;</p>
     <p>Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,</p>
     <p>And join thy voice unto the Angel Quire,</p>
     <p>From out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire.</p>
     <p>The Hymn</p>
     <p>I</p>
     <p>It was the winter wild,</p>
     <p>While the heaven-born child</p>
     <p>All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;</p>
     <p>Nature, in awe to him,</p>
     <p>Had doffed her gaudy trim,</p>
     <p>With her great Master so to sympathize:</p>
     <p>It was no season then for her</p>
     <p>To wanton with the Sun, her lusty Paramour.</p>
     <p>II</p>
     <p>Only with speeches fair</p>
     <p>She woos the gentle air</p>
     <p>To hide her guilty front with innocent snow,</p>
     <p>And on her naked shame,</p>
     <p>Pollute with sinful blame,</p>
     <p>The saintly veil of maiden white to throw;</p>
     <p>Confounded, that her Maker’s eyes</p>
     <p>Should look so near upon her foul deformities.</p>
     <p>III</p>
     <p>But he, her fears to cease,</p>
     <p>Sent down the meek-eyed Peace:</p>
     <p>She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding</p>
     <p>Down through the turning sphere,</p>
     <p>His ready Harbinger,</p>
     <p>With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing;</p>
     <p>And, waving wide her myrtle wand,</p>
     <p>She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.</p>
     <p>IV</p>
     <p>No war, or battail’s sound,</p>
     <p>Was heard the world around;</p>
     <p>The idle spear and shield were high uphung;</p>
     <p>The hookèd chariot stood,</p>
     <p>Unstained with hostile blood;</p>
     <p>The trumpet spake not to the armèd throng;</p>
     <p>And Kings sat still with awful eye,</p>
     <p>As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.</p>
     <p>V</p>
     <p>But peaceful was the night</p>
     <p>Wherein the Prince of Light</p>
     <p>His reign of peace upon the earth began.</p>
     <p>The winds, with wonder whist,</p>
     <p>Smoothly the waters kissed,</p>
     <p>Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean,</p>
     <p>Who now hath quite forgot to rave,</p>
     <p>While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.</p>
     <p>VI</p>
     <p>The stars, with deep amaze,</p>
     <p>Stand fixed in steadfast gaze,</p>
     <p>Bending one way their precious influence,</p>
     <p>And will not take their flight,</p>
     <p>For all the morning light,</p>
     <p>Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;</p>
     <p>But in their glimmering orbs did glow,</p>
     <p>Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.</p>
     <p>VII</p>
     <p>And, though the shady gloom</p>
     <p>Had given day her room,</p>
     <p>The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed,</p>
     <p>And hid his head of shame,</p>
     <p>As his inferior flame</p>
     <p>The new-enlightened world no more should need:</p>
     <p>He saw a greater Sun appear</p>
     <p>Than his bright Throne or burning axletree could bear.</p>
     <p>VIII</p>
     <p>The Shepherds on the lawn,</p>
     <p>Or ere the point of dawn,</p>
     <p>Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;</p>
     <p>Full little thought they than</p>
     <p>That the mighty Pan</p>
     <p>Was kindly come to live with them below:</p>
     <p>Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,</p>
     <p>Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.</p>
     <p>IX</p>
     <p>When such music sweet</p>
     <p>Their hearts and ears did greet</p>
     <p>As never was by mortal finger strook,</p>
     <p>Divinely-warbled voice</p>
     <p>Answering the stringèd noise,</p>
     <p>As all their souls in blissful rapture took:</p>
     <p>The air, such pleasure loth to lose,</p>
     <p>With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.</p>
     <p>X</p>
     <p>Nature, that heard such sound</p>
     <p>Beneath the hollow round</p>
     <p>Of Cynthia’s seat the airy Region thrilling,</p>
     <p>Now was almost won</p>
     <p>To think her part was done,</p>
     <p>And that her reign had here its last fulfilling:</p>
     <p>She knew such harmony alone</p>
     <p>Could hold all Heaven and Earth in happier union.</p>
     <p>XI</p>
     <p>At last surrounds their sight</p>
     <p>A globe of circular light,</p>
     <p>That with long beams the shamefaced Night arrayed;</p>
     <p>The helmèd Cherubim</p>
     <p>And sworded Seraphim</p>
     <p>Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed,</p>
     <p>Harping in loud and solemn quire,</p>
     <p>With unexpressive notes, to Heaven’s newborn Heir.</p>
     <p>XII</p>
     <p>Such music (as ’tis said)</p>
     <p>Before was never made,</p>
     <p>But when of old the Sons of Morning sung,</p>
     <p>While the Creator great</p>
     <p>His constellations set,</p>
     <p>And the well-balanced World on hinges hung,</p>
     <p>And cast the dark foundations deep,</p>
     <p>And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep.</p>
     <p>XIII</p>
     <p>Ring out, ye crystal spheres!</p>
     <p>Once bless our human ears,</p>
     <p>If ye have power to touch our senses so;</p>
     <p>And let your silver chime</p>
     <p>Move in melodious time;</p>
     <p>And let the bass of heaven’s deep organ blow;</p>
     <p>And with your ninefold harmony</p>
     <p>Make up full consort of the angelic symphony.</p>
     <p>XIV</p>
     <p>For, if such holy song</p>
     <p>Enwrap our fancy long,</p>
     <p>Time will run back and fetch the Age of Gold;</p>
     <p>And speckled Vanity</p>
     <p>Will sicken soon and die,</p>
     <p>And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;</p>
     <p>And Hell itself will pass away,</p>
     <p>And leave her dolorous mansions of the peering day.</p>
     <p>XV</p>
     <p>Yes, Truth and Justice then</p>
     <p>Will down return to men,</p>
     <p>The enamelled arras of the rainbow wearing;</p>
     <p>And Mercy set between,</p>
     <p>Throned in celestial sheen,</p>
     <p>With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering;</p>
     <p>And Heaven, as at some festival,</p>
     <p>Will open wide the gates of her high palace-hall.</p>
     <p>XVI</p>
     <p>But wisest Fate says No,</p>
     <p>This must not yet be so;</p>
     <p>The Babe lies yet in smiling infancy</p>
     <p>That on the bitter cross</p>
     <p>Must redeem our loss,</p>
     <p>So both himself and us to glorify:</p>
     <p>Yet first, to those chained in sleep,</p>
     <p>The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,</p>
     <p>XVII</p>
     <p>With such a horrid clang</p>
     <p>As on Mount Sinai rang,</p>
     <p>While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake:</p>
     <p>The aged Earth, aghast</p>
     <p>With terror of that blast,</p>
     <p>Shall from the surface to the centre shake,</p>
     <p>When, at the world’s last sessiön,</p>
     <p>The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne.</p>
     <p>XVIII</p>
     <p>And then at last our bliss</p>
     <p>Full and perfect is,</p>
     <p>But now begins; for from this happy day</p>
     <p>The Old Dragon under ground,</p>
     <p>In straiter limits bound,</p>
     <p>Not half so far casts his usurpèd sway,</p>
     <p>And, wroth to see his Kingdom fail,</p>
     <p>Swindges the scaly horror of his folded tail.</p>
     <p>XIX</p>
     <p>The Oracles are dumb;</p>
     <p>No voice or hideous hum</p>
     <p>Runs through the archèd roof in words deceiving.</p>
     <p>Apollo from his shrine</p>
     <p>Can no more divine,</p>
     <p>Will hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.</p>
     <p>No nightly trance, or breathèd spell,</p>
     <p>Inspires the pale-eyed Priest from the prophetic cell.</p>
     <p>XX</p>
     <p>The lonely mountains o’er,</p>
     <p>And the resounding shore,</p>
     <p>A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;</p>
     <p>Edgèd with poplar pale,</p>
     <p>From haunted spring, and dale</p>
     <p>The parting Genius is with sighing sent;</p>
     <p>With flower-inwoven tresses torn</p>
     <p>The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.</p>
     <p>XXI</p>
     <p>In consecrated earth,</p>
     <p>And on the holy hearth,</p>
     <p>The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;</p>
     <p>In urns, and altars round,</p>
     <p>A drear and dying sound</p>
     <p>Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;</p>
     <p>And the chill marble seems to sweat,</p>
     <p>While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.</p>
     <p>XXII</p>
     <p>Peor and Baälim</p>
     <p>Forsake their temples dim,</p>
     <p>With that twice-battered god of Palestine;</p>
     <p>And moonèd Ashtaroth,</p>
     <p>Heaven’s Queen and Mother both,</p>
     <p>Now sits not girt with tapers’ holy shine:</p>
     <p>The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn;</p>
     <p>In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.</p>
     <p>XXIII</p>
     <p>And sullen Moloch, fled,</p>
     <p>Hath left in shadows dread</p>
     <p>His burning idol all of blackest hue;</p>
     <p>In vain with cymbals’ ring</p>
     <p>They call the grisly king,</p>
     <p>In dismal dance about the furnace blue;</p>
     <p>The brutish gods of Nile as fast,</p>
     <p>Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste.</p>
     <p>XXIV</p>
     <p>Nor is Osiris seen</p>
     <p>In Memphian grove or green,</p>
     <p>Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud;</p>
     <p>Nor can he be at rest</p>
     <p>Within his sacred chest;</p>
     <p>Nought but profoundest Hell can be his shroud;</p>
     <p>In vain, with timbreled anthems dark,</p>
     <p>The sable-stolèd Sorcerers bear his worshiped ark.</p>
     <p>XXV</p>
     <p>He feels from Juda’s land</p>
     <p>The dreaded Infant’s hand;</p>
     <p>The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;</p>
     <p>Nor all the gods beside</p>
     <p>Longer dare abide,</p>
     <p>Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:</p>
     <p>Our Babe, to show his Godhead true,</p>
     <p>Can in his swaddling bands control the damnèd crew.</p>
     <p>XXVI</p>
     <p>So, when the Sun in bed,</p>
     <p>Curtained with cloudy red,</p>
     <p>Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,</p>
     <p>The flocking shadows pale</p>
     <p>Troop to the infernal jail,</p>
     <p>Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave,</p>
     <p>And the yellow-skirted Fays</p>
     <p>Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze.</p>
     <p>XXVII</p>
     <p>But see! the Virgin blest</p>
     <p>Hath laid her Babe to rest,</p>
     <p>Time is our tedious song should here have ending:</p>
     <p>Heaven’s youngest-teemèd star</p>
     <p>Hath fixed her polished car,</p>
     <p>Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending;</p>
     <p>And all about the courtly stable</p>
     <p>Bright-harnessed Angels sit in order serviceable.</p>
     <p>A Paraphrase on Psalm CXIV</p>
     <p>(1624)</p>
     <p>WHEN the blest seed of Terah’s faithful Son</p>
     <p>After long toil their liberty had won,</p>
     <p>And passed from Pharian fields to Canaanland,</p>
     <p>Led by the strength of the Almighty’s hand,</p>
     <p>Jehovah’s wonders were in Israel shown,</p>
     <p>His praise and glory was in Israel known.</p>
     <p>That saw the troubled sea, and shivering fled,</p>
     <p>And sought to hide his froth-becurlèd head</p>
     <p>Low in the earth; Jordan’s clear streams recoil,</p>
     <p>As a faint host that hath received the foil.</p>
     <p>The high huge-bellied mountains skip like rams</p>
     <p>Amongst their ewes, the little hills like lambs.</p>
     <p>Why fled the ocean? and why skipped the mountains?</p>
     <p>Why turnèd Jordan toward his crystal fountains?</p>
     <p>Shake, Earth, and at the presence be aghast</p>
     <p>Of Him that ever was and aye shall last,</p>
     <p>That glassy floods from rugged rocks can crush,</p>
     <p>And make soft rills from fiery flint-stones gush.</p>
     <p>Psalm CXXXVI</p>
     <p>LET us with a gladsome mind</p>
     <p>Praise the Lord for he is kind;</p>
     <p>For his mercies aye endure,</p>
     <p>Ever faithful, ever sure.</p>
     <p>Let us blaze his Name abroad,</p>
     <p>For of gods he is the God;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>O let us his praises tell,</p>
     <p>That doth the wrathful tyrants quell;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>That with his miracles doth make</p>
     <p>Amazèd Heaven and Earth to shake;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>That by his wisdom did create</p>
     <p>The painted heavens so full of state;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>That did the solid Earth ordain</p>
     <p>To rise above the watery plain;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>That by his all-commanding might,</p>
     <p>Did fill the new-made world with light;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>And caused the golden-tressèd Sun</p>
     <p>All the day long his course to run;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>The hornèd Moon to shine by night</p>
     <p>Amongst her spangled sisters bright;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>He, with his thunder-clasping hand,</p>
     <p>Smote the first-born of Egypt land;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>And, in despite of Pharao fell,</p>
     <p>He brought from thence his Israel;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>The ruddy waves he cleft in twain</p>
     <p>Of the Erythræan main;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>The floods stood still, like walls of glass,</p>
     <p>While the Hebrew bands did pass;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>But full soon they did devour</p>
     <p>The tawny King with all his power;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>His chosen people he did bless</p>
     <p>In the wasteful Wilderness;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>In bloody battail he brought down</p>
     <p>Kings of prowess and renown;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>He foiled bold Seon and his host,</p>
     <p>That ruled the Amorrean coast;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>And large-limbed Og he did subdue,</p>
     <p>With all his over-hardy crew;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>And to his servant Israel</p>
     <p>He gave their land, therein to dwell;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>He hath, with a piteous eye,</p>
     <p>Beheld us in our misery;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>And freed us from the slavery</p>
     <p>Of the invading enemy;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>All living creatures he doth feed,</p>
     <p>And with full hand supplies their need;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>Let us, therefore, warble forth</p>
     <p>His mighty majesty and worth;</p>
     <p>For his, &amp;c.</p>
     <p>That his mansion hath on high,</p>
     <p>Above the reach of mortal eye;</p>
     <p>For his mercies aye endure,</p>
     <p>Ever faithful, ever sure.</p>

     <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
     <p>In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.</p>
     <p>PRAISE be to God, the Beneficent King, the Creator of the universe, who hath raised the heavens without pillars, and</p>
     <p>spread out the earth as a bed; and blessing and peace be on the lord of apostles, our lord and our master Mohammad,</p>
     <p>and his Family; blessing and peace, enduring and constant, unto the day of judgment.</p>
     <p>To proceed:—The lives of former generations are a lesson to posterity; that a man may review the remarkable events</p>
     <p>which have happened to others, and be admonished; and may consider the history of people of preceding ages, and of</p>
     <p>all that hath befallen them, and be restrained. Extolled be the perfection of Him who hath thus ordained the history</p>
     <p>of former generations to be a lesson to those which follow. Such are the Tales of a Thousand and One Nights, with</p>
     <p>their romantic stories and their fables.</p>
     <p>It is related (but God alone is all-knowing, as well as all-wise, and almighty, and all-bountiful), that there was, in</p>
     <p>ancient times, a King of the countries of India and China, possessing numerous troops, and guards, and servants, and</p>
     <p>domestic dependents; and he had two sons; one of whom was a man of mature age; and the other, a youth. Both of</p>
     <p>these princes were brave horsemen; but especially the elder, who inherited the kingdom of his father, and governed</p>
     <p>his subjects with such justice that the inhabitants of his country and whole empire loved him. He was called King</p>
     <p>Shahriyar: his younger brother was named Shah-Zeman, 1 and was King of Samarkand. The administration of their</p>
     <p>governments was conducted with rectitude, each of them ruling over his subjects with justice during a period of</p>
     <p>twenty years with the utmost enjoyment and happiness. After this period, the elder King felt a strong desire to see</p>
     <p>his brother, and ordered his Wezir 2 to repair to him and bring him.</p>
     <p>Having taken the advice of the Wezir on this subject, he immediately gave orders to prepare handsome presents, such</p>
     <p>as horses adorned with gold and costly jewels, and memluks, 3 and beautiful virgins, and expensive stuffs. He then</p>
     <p>wrote a letter to his brother, expressive of his great desire to see him; and having sealed it, and given it to the Wezir,</p>
     <p>together with the presents above mentioned, he ordered the minister to strain his nerves, and tuck up his skirts, and</p>
     <p>use all expedition in returning. The Wezir answered, without delay, I hear and obey; and forthwith prepared for the</p>
     <p>journey: he packed his baggage, removed the burdens, and made ready all his provisions within three days; and on</p>
     <p>the fourth day, he took leave of the King Shahriyar, and went forth towards the deserts and wastes. He proceeded</p>
     <p>night and day; and each of the kings under the authority of King Shahriyar by whose residence he passed came forth</p>
     <p>to meet him, with costly presents, and gifts of gold and silver, and entertained him three days; after which, on the</p>
     <p>fourth day, he accompanied him one day’s journey, and took leave of him. Thus he continued on his way until he drew</p>
     <p>near to the city of Samarkand, when he sent forward a messenger to inform King Shah-Zeman of his approach. The</p>
     <p>messenger entered the city, inquired the way to the palace, and, introducing himself to the King, kissed the ground</p>
     <p>before him, and acquainted him with the approach of his brother’s Wezir; upon which Shah-Zeman ordered the chief</p>
     <p>officers of his court, and the great men of his kingdom, to go forth a day’s journey to meet him; and they did so; and</p>
     <p>when they met him, they welcomed him, and walked by his stirrups until they returned to the city. The Wezir then</p>
     <p>presented himself before the King Shah-Zeman, greeted him with a prayer for he divine assistance in his favour,</p>
     <p>kissed the ground before him, and informed him of his brother’s desire to see him; after which he handed to him the</p>
     <p>letter. The King took it, read it, and understood its contents; and answered by expressing his readiness to obey the</p>
     <p>commands of his brother. But, said he (addressing the Wezir), I will not go until I have entertained thee three days.</p>
     <p>Accordingly, he lodged him in a palace befitting his rank, accommodated his troops in tents, and appointed them all</p>
     <p>things requisite in the way of food and drink: and so they remained three days. On the fourth day, he equipped</p>
     <p>himself for the journey, made ready his baggage, and collected together costly presents suitable to his brother’s</p>
     <p>dignity.</p>
     <p>These preparations being completed, he sent forth his tents and camels and mules and servants and guards,</p>
     <p>appointed his Wezir to be governor of the country during his absence, and set out towards his brother’s dominions. At</p>
     <p>midnight, however, he remembered that he had left in his palace an article which he should have brought with him;</p>
     <p>and having returned to the palace to fetch it, he there beheld his wife sleeping in his bed, and attended by a male</p>
     <p>negro slave, who had fallen asleep by her side.</p>
     <p>On beholding this scene, the world became black before his eyes; and he said within himself, If this is the case when I</p>
     <p>have not departed from the city, what will be the conduct of this vile woman while I am sojourning with my brother?</p>
     <p>He then drew this sword, and slew them both in the bed: after which he immediately returned, gave orders for</p>
     <p>departure, and journeyed to his brother’s capital.</p>
     <p>Shahriyar, rejoicing at the tidings of his approach, went forth to meet him, saluted him, and welcomed him with the</p>
     <p>utmost delight. He then ordered that the city should be decorated on the occasion, and sat down to entertain his</p>
     <p>brother with cheerful conversation: but the mind of King Shah-Zeman was distracted by reflections upon the conduct</p>
     <p>of his wife; excessive grief took possession of him; and his countenance became sallow; and his frame emaciated. His</p>
     <p>brother observed his altered condition, and, imagining that it was occasioned by his absence from his dominions,</p>
     <p>abstained from troubling him or asking respecting the cause, until after the lapse of some days, when at length he</p>
     <p>said to him, O my brother, I perceive that thy body is emaciated, and thy countenance is become sallow. He</p>
     <p>answered, O brother, I have an internal sore:—and he informed him not of the conduct of his wife which he had</p>
     <p>witnessed. Shahriyar then said, I wish that thou wouldest go out with me on a hunting excursion; perhaps thy mind</p>
     <p>might so be diverted:—but he declined; and Shahriyar went alone to the chase.</p>
     <p>Now there were some windows in the King’s palace commanding a view of his garden; and while his brother was</p>
     <p>looking out from one of these, a door of the palace was opened, and there came forth from it twenty females and</p>
     <p>twenty male black slaves; and the King’s wife, who was distinguished by extraordinary beauty and elegance,</p>
     <p>accompanied them to a fountain, where they all disrobed themselves, and sat down together. The King’s wife then</p>
     <p>called out, O Mes’ud! and immediately a black slave came to her, and embraced her; she doing the like. So also did</p>
     <p>the other slaves and the women; and all of them continued revelling together until the close of the day. When Shah-</p>
     <p>Zeman beheld this spectacle he said within himself, By Allah! my affliction is lighter than this! His vexation and grief</p>
     <p>were alleviated, and he no longer abstained from sufficient food and drink.</p>
     <p>When his brother returned from his excursion, and they had saluted each other, and King Shahriyar observed his</p>
     <p>brother Shah-Zeman, that his colour had returned, that his face had recovered the flush of health and that he ate</p>
     <p>with appetite, after his late abstinence, he was surprised, and said, O my brother, when I saw thee last, thy</p>
     <p>countenance was sallow, and now thy colour hath returned to thee: acquaint me with thy state.—As to the change of</p>
     <p>my natural complexion, answered Shah-Zeman, I will inform thee of its cause; but excuse my explaining to thee the</p>
     <p>return of my colour.—First, said Shahriyar, relate to me the cause of the change of thy proper complexion, and of thy</p>
     <p>weakness: let me hear it.—Know then, O my brother, he answered, that when thou sentest thy Wezir to me to invite</p>
     <p>me to thy presence, I prepared myself for the journey, and when I had gone forth from the city, I remembered that I</p>
     <p>had left behind me the jewel that I had gone forth from the city, I remembered that I had left behind me the jewel</p>
     <p>that I have given thee; I therefore returned to my palace for it, and there I found my wife sleeping in my bed, and</p>
     <p>attended by a black male slave; and I killed them both, and came to thee: but my mind was occupied by reflections</p>
     <p>upon this affair, and this was the cause of the change of my complexion, and of my weakness: now, as to the return of</p>
     <p>my colour, excuse my informing thee of its cause.—But when his brother heard these words, he said, I conjure thee by</p>
     <p>Allah that thou acquaint me with the cause of the return of thy colour:—so he repeated to him all that he had seen. I</p>
     <p>would see this, said Shahriyar, with my own eye.—Then, said Shah-Zeman, give out that thou art going again to the</p>
     <p>chase, and conceal thyself here with me, and thou shalt witness this conduct, and obtain ocular proof of it.</p>
     <p>Shahriyar, upon this, immediately announced that it was his intention to make another excursion. The troops went out</p>
     <p>of the city with the tents, and the King followed them; and after he had reposed awhile in the camp, he said to his</p>
     <p>servants, Let no one come in to me:—and he disguised himself, and returned to his brother in the palace, and sat in</p>
     <p>one of the windows overlooking the garden; and when he had been there a short time, the women and their mistress</p>
     <p>entered the garden with the black slaves, and did as his brother had described, continuing so until the hour of the</p>
     <p>afternoon-prayer.</p>
     <p>When King Shahriyar beheld this occurrence, reason fled from his head, and he said to his brother, Shah-Zeman, Arise,</p>
     <p>and let us travel whither we please, and renounce the regal state, until we see whether such a calamity as this have</p>
     <p>befallen any other person like unto us; and if not, our death will be preferable to our life. His brother agreed to his</p>
     <p>proposal, and they went out from a private door of the palace, and journeyed continually, days and nights, until they</p>
     <p>arrived at a tree in the midst of a meadow, by a spring of water, on the shore of the sea. They drank of this spring,</p>
     <p>and sat down to rest; and when the day had a little advanced, the sea became troubled before them, and there arose</p>
     <p>from it a black pillar, ascending towards the sky, and approaching the meadow. Struck with fear at the sight, they</p>
     <p>climbed up into the tree, which was lofty; and thence they gazed to see what this might be: and behold, it was a</p>
     <p>Jinni 4 of gigantic stature, broad-fronted and bulky, bearing on his head a chest. He landed, and came to the tree</p>
     <p>into which the two kings had climbed, and, having seated himself beneath it, opened the chest, and took out of it</p>
     <p>another box, which he also opened; and there came forth from it a young woman, fair and beautiful, like the shining</p>
     <p>sun. When the Jinni cast his eyes upon her, he said, O lady of noble race, whom I carried off on thy wedding-night, I</p>
     <p>have a desire to sleep a little: and he placed his head upon her knee, and slept. The damsel then raised her head</p>
     <p>towards the tree, and saw there the two Kings; upon which she removed the head of the Jinni from her knee, and,</p>
     <p>having placed it on the ground, stood under the tree, and made signs to the two Kings, as though she would say, Come</p>
     <p>down, and fear not this ‘Efrit. They answered her, We conjure thee by Allah that thou excuse us in this matter. But</p>
     <p>she said, I conjure you by the same that ye come down; and if ye do not, I will rouse this ‘Efrit, and shall put you to a</p>
     <p>cruel death. So, being afraid, they came down to her; and, after they had remained with her as long as she required,</p>
     <p>she took from her pocket a purse, and drew out from this a string, upon which were ninety-eight seal-rings; and she</p>
     <p>said to them, Know ye what are these? They answered, We know not.—The owners of these rings, said she, have, all</p>
     <p>of them, been admitted to converse with me, like as ye have, unknown to this foolish ‘Efrit; therefore, give me your</p>
     <p>two rings, ye brothers. So they gave her their two rings from their fingers; and then she said to them, This ‘Efrit</p>
     <p>carried me off on my wedding-night, and put me in the box, and placed the box in the chest, and affixed to the chest</p>
     <p>seven locks, and deposited me thus imprisoned, in the bottom of the roaring sea, beneath the dashing waves; not</p>
     <p>knowing that, when one of our sex desires to accomplish any object, nothing can prevent her. In accordance with</p>
     <p>this, says one of the poets:</p>
     <p>Never trust in women; nor rely upon their vows;</p>
     <p>For their pleasure and displeasure depend upon their passions.</p>
     <p>They offer a false affection; for perfidy lurks within their clothing.</p>
     <p>By the tale of Yusuf be admonished, and guard against their stratagems.</p>
     <p>Dost thou not consider that Iblis ejected Adam by means of woman?</p>
     <p>And another poet says:—</p>
     <p>Abstain from censure; for it will strengthen the censured, and increase desire into violent passion.</p>
     <p>If I suffer such passion, my case is but the same that as of many a man before me:</p>
     <p>For greatly indeed to be wondered at is he who hath kept himself safe from women’s artifice.</p>
     <p>When the two Kings heard these words from her lips they were struck with the utmost astonishment, and said, one to</p>
     <p>the other, If this is an ‘Efrit, and a greater calamity hath happened unto him than that which hath befallen us, this is</p>
     <p>a circumstance that should console us:—and immediately they departed, and returned to the city.</p>
     <p>As soon as they had entered the palace, Shahriyar caused his wife to be beheaded, and in like manner the women and</p>
     <p>black slaves; and thenceforth he made it his regular custom, every time that he took a virgin to his bed, to kill her at</p>
     <p>the expiration of the night. Thus he continued to do during a period of three years; and the people raised an outcry</p>
     <p>against him, and fled with their daughters, and there remained not a virgin in the city of a sufficient age for</p>
     <p>marriage. Such was the case when the King ordered the Wezir to bring him a virgin according to his custom; and the</p>
     <p>Wezir went forth and searched, and found none; and he went back to his house enraged and vexed, fearing what the</p>
     <p>King might do to him.</p>
     <p>Now the Wezir had two daughters; the elder of whom was named Shahrazad; and the younger, Dunyzad. The former</p>
     <p>had read various books of histories, and the lives of preceding kings, and stories of past generations: it is asserted</p>
     <p>that she had collected together a thousand books of histories, relating to preceding generations and kings, and works</p>
     <p>of the poets: and she said to her father on this occasion, Why do I see thee thus changed, and oppressed with</p>
     <p>solicitude and sorrows? It has been said by one of the poets:—</p>
     <p>Tell him who is oppressed with anxiety, that anxiety will not last:</p>
     <p>As happiness passeth away, so passeth away anxiety.</p>
     <p>When the Wezir heard these words from his daughter, he related to her all that had happened to him with regard to</p>
     <p>the King: upon which she said, By Allah, O my father, give me in marriage to this King: either I shall die, and be a</p>
     <p>ransom for one of the daughters of the Muslims, or I shall live, and be the cause of their deliverance from him. I</p>
     <p>conjure thee by Allah, exclaimed he, that thou expose not thyself to such peril:—but she said, It must be so. Then,</p>
     <p>said he, I fear for thee that the same will befall thee that happened in the case of the Ass and the Bull and the</p>
     <p>husbandman.—And what, she asked, was that, O my father?</p>
     <p>Know, O my daughter, said the Wezir, that there was a certain merchant, who possessed wealth and cattle, and had a</p>
     <p>wife and children; and God, whose name be exalted, had also endowed him with the knowledge of the languages of</p>
     <p>beasts and birds. The abode of this merchant was in the country; and he had, in his house, an ass and a bull. When</p>
     <p>the bull came to the place where the ass was tied, he found it swept and sprinkled; in his manger were sifted barley</p>
     <p>and sifted cut straw, and the ass was lying at his ease; his master being accustomed only to ride him occasionally,</p>
     <p>when business required, and soon to return: and it happened, one day, that the merchant overheard the bull saying to</p>
     <p>the ass, May thy food benefit thee! I am oppressed with fatigue, while thou art enjoying repose: thou eatest sifted</p>
     <p>barley, and men serve thee; and it is only occasionally that thy master rides thee, and returns; while I am continually</p>
     <p>employed in ploughing, and turning the mill.—The ass answered, When thou goest out to the field, and they place the</p>
     <p>yoke upon thy neck, lie down, and do not rise again, even if they beat thee; or, if thou rise, lie down a second time;</p>
     <p>and when they take thee back, and place the beans before thee, eat them not, as though thou wert sick: abstain</p>
     <p>from eating and drinking a day or two days, or three; and so shalt thou find rest from trouble and labour.—</p>
     <p>Accordingly, when the driver came to the bull with his fodder, he ate scarcely any of it; and on the morrow, when the</p>
     <p>driver came again to take him to plough, he found him apparently quite infirm: so the merchant said, Take the ass,</p>
     <p>and make him draw the plough in his stead all the day. The man did so; and when the ass returned at the close of the</p>
     <p>day, the bull thanked him for the favour he had conferred upon him by relieving him of his trouble on that day; but</p>
     <p>the ass returned him no answer, for he repented most grievously. On the next day, the ploughman came again, and</p>
     <p>took the ass, and ploughed with him till evening; and the ass returned with his neck flayed by the yoke, and reduced</p>
     <p>to an extreme state of weakness; and the bull looked upon him, and thanked and praised him. The ass exclaimed, I</p>
     <p>was living at ease, and nought but my meddling hath injured me! Then said he to the bull, Know that I am one who</p>
     <p>would give thee good advice: I heard our master say, If the bull rise not from his place, take him to the butcher, that</p>
     <p>he may kill him, and make a nat’ 5 of his skin:—I am therefore in fear for thee, and so I have given thee advice; and</p>
     <p>peace be on thee!—When the bull heard these words of the ass, he thanked him, and said, To-morrow I will go with</p>
     <p>alacrity:—so he ate the whole of his fodder, and even licked the manger.—Their master, meanwhile, was listening to</p>
     <p>their conversation.</p>
     <p>On the following morning, the merchant and his wife went to the bull’s crib, and sat down there; and the driver</p>
     <p>came, and took out the bull; and when the bull saw his master, he shook his tail, and showed his alacrity by sounds</p>
     <p>and actions, bounding about in such a manner that the merchant laughed until he fell backwards. His wife, in</p>
     <p>surprise, asked him, At what dost thou laugh? He answered, At a thing that I have heard and seen; but I cannot reveal</p>
     <p>it; for if I did, I should die. She said, Thou must inform me of the cause of thy laughter, even if thou die.—I cannot</p>
     <p>reveal it, said he: the fear of death prevents me.—Thou laughedst only at me, she said; and she ceased not to urge</p>
     <p>and importune him until he was quite overcome and distracted. So he called together his children and sent for the</p>
     <p>Kadi and witnesses, that he might make his will, and reveal the secret to her, and die: for he loved her excessively,</p>
     <p>since she was the daughter of his paternal uncle, and the mother of his children, and he had lived with her to the age</p>
     <p>of a hundred and twenty years. Having assembled her family and his neighbours, he related to them his story, and</p>
     <p>told them that as soon as he revealed his secret he must die; upon which every one present said to her, We conjure</p>
     <p>thee by Allah that thou give up this affair, and let not thy husband, and the father of thy children, die. But she said, I</p>
     <p>will not desist until he tell me, though he die for it. So they ceased to solicit her; and the merchant left them, and</p>
     <p>went to the stable to perform the ablution, and then to return, and tell them the secret, and die.</p>
     <p>Now he had a cock, with fifty hens under him, and he had also a dog; and he heard the dog call to the cock, and</p>
     <p>reproach him, saying, Art thou happy when our master is going to die? The cock asked, How so?—and the dog related</p>
     <p>to him the story; upon which the cock exclaimed, By Allah! our master has little sense: I have fifty wives; and I please</p>
     <p>this, and provoke that; while he has but one one wife, and cannot manage this affair with her: why does he not take</p>
     <p>some twigs of the mulberry tree, and enter her chamber, and beat her until she dies or repents? She would never,</p>
     <p>after that ask him a question respecting anything.—And when the merchant heard the words of the cock, as he</p>
     <p>addressed the dog, he recovered his reason, and made up his mind to beat her.—Now, said the Wezir to his daughter</p>
     <p>Shahrazad, perhaps I may do to thee as the merchant did to his wife. She asked, And what did he? He answered, He</p>
     <p>entered her chamber after he had cut off some twigs of the mulberry tree, and hidden them there; and then said to</p>
     <p>her, Come into the chamber, that I may tell thee the secret while no one sees me, and then die:—and when she had</p>
     <p>entered, he locked the chamber door upon her, and beat her until she became almost senseless and cried out, I</p>
     <p>repent:—and she kissed his hands and his feet, and repented, and went out with him; and all the company, and her</p>
     <p>own family, rejoiced; and they lived together in the happiest manner until death.</p>
     <p>When the Wezir’s daughter heard the words of her father, she said to him, It must be as I have requested. So he</p>
     <p>arrayed her, Shahriyar. Now she had given directions to her younger sister saying to her, When I have gone to the King,</p>
     <p>I will send to request thee to come; and when thou comest to me, and seest a convenient time, do thou say to me, O</p>
     <p>my sister, relate to me some strange story to beguile our waking hour:—and I will relate to thee a story that shall, if it</p>
     <p>be the will of God, be the means of procuring deliverance.</p>
     <p>Her father, the Wezir, then took her to the King, who, when he saw him, was rejoiced, and said, Hast thou brought</p>
     <p>me what I desired? He answered Yes. When the King, therefore, introduced himself to her, she wept; and he said to</p>
     <p>her, What aileth thee? She answered, O King, I Have a young sister, and I wish to take leave of her. So the King sent to</p>
     <p>her; and she came to her sister, and embraced her, and sat near the foot of the bed; and after she had waited for a</p>
     <p>proper opportunity, she said, By Allah! O my sister, relate to us a story to beguile the waking hour of our night. Most</p>
     <p>willingly, answered Shahrazad, if this virtuous King permit me. And the King, hearing these words, and being restless,</p>
     <p>was pleased with the idea of listening to the story; and thus, on the first night of the thousand and one, Shahrazad</p>
     <p>commenced her recitations.</p>
     <p>1. Shahriyar, “Friend of the City;” Shah-Zeman, “King of the Age.”</p>
     <p>2. In Persian and Turkish, Vezir; popular, Vizier.</p>
     <p>3. Male white slaves.</p>
     <p>4. Sing. of Jinn (Genii), being created of fire. The species of Jinn is said to have been created some thousands of</p>
     <p>years before Adam. According to a tradition from the Prophet, this species consists of five orders or classes; namely,</p>
     <p>Jann (who are the least powerful of all), Jinn, Sheytans (or Devils), ‘Efrits, and Marids. The last, it is added, are the</p>
     <p>most powerful; and the Jann are transformed Jinn; like as certain apes and swine were transformed men. The terms</p>
     <p>Jinn and Jann, however, are generally used indiscriminately, as names of the whole species (including the other</p>
     <p>orders above mentioned), whether good or bad; the former term in the more common. [Iblis is Satan, their King.]</p>
     <p>“Sheytan” is commonly used to signify any evil Jinn. An ‘Efrit is a powerful evil Jinni: a Madrid, an evil Jinni of the</p>
     <p>most powerful class. The Jinn (but generally speaking, evil ones) are called by the Persians Divs; the most powerful</p>
     <p>evil Jinn, Narahs (which signifies “males,” though they are said to be males and females); the good Jinn, Peris,</p>
     <p>though this term is commonly applied to females.</p>

     <p>I STOOD one day in a Swiss village at the foot of the Jura, and watched the coming of the storm. Heavy black clouds,</p>
     <p>their edges purpled by the setting sun, were rapidly covering the loveliest sky in Europe, save that of Italy. Thunder</p>
     <p>growled in the distance, and gusts of biting wind were driving huge drops of rain over the thirsty plain. Looking</p>
     <p>upwards, I beheld a large Alpine falcon, now rising, now sinking, as he floated bravely in the very midst of the storm</p>
     <p>and I could almost fancy that he strove to battle with it. At every fresh peal of thunder, the noble bird bounded</p>
     <p>higher aloft, as if in answering defiance. I followed him with my eyes for a long time, until he disappeared in the</p>
     <p>east. On the ground, about fifty paces beneath me, stood a stork; perfectly tranquil and impassive in the midst of the</p>
     <p>warring elements. Twice or thrice she turned her head towards the quarter from whence the wind came, with an</p>
     <p>indescribable air of half indifferent curiosity; but at length she drew up one of her long sinewy legs, hid her head</p>
     <p>beneath her wing, and calmly composed herself to sleep.</p>
     <p>I thought of Byron and Goethe; of the stormy sky that overhung both; of the tempest-tossed existence, the life-long</p>
     <p>struggle, of the one, and the calm of the other; and of the two mighty sources of poetry exhausted and closed by</p>
     <p>them.</p>
     <p>Byron and Goethe—the two names that predominate, and, come what may, ever will predominate, over our every</p>
     <p>recollection of the fifty years that have passed away. They rule; the master-minds, I might almost say the tyrants, of</p>
     <p>a whole period of poetry; brilliant, yet sad; glorious in youth and daring, yet cankered by the worm i’ the bud,</p>
     <p>despair. They are the two representative poets of two great schools; and around them we are compelled to group all</p>
     <p>the lesser minds which contributed to render the era illustrious. The qualities which adorn and distinguish their works</p>
     <p>are to be found, although more thinly scattered, in other poets their contemporaries; still theirs are the names that</p>
     <p>involuntarily rise to our lips whenever we seek to characterize the tendencies of the age in which they lived. Their</p>
     <p>genius pursued different, even opposite routes; and yet very rarely do our thoughts turn to either without evoking the</p>
     <p>image of the other, as a sort of necessary complement to the first. The eyes of Europe were fixed upon the pair, as</p>
     <p>the spectators gaze on two mighty wrestlers in the same arena; and they, like noble and generous adversaries,</p>
     <p>admired, praised, and held out the hand to each other. Many poets have followed in their footsteps; none have been</p>
     <p>so popular. Others have found judges and critics who have appreciated them calmly and impartially; not so they: for</p>
     <p>them there have been only enthusiasts or enemies, wreaths or stones; and when they vanished into the vast night</p>
     <p>that envelops and transforms alike men and things—silence reigned around their tombs. Little by little, poetry had</p>
     <p>passed away from our world, and it seemed as if their last sigh had extinguished the sacred flame.</p>
     <p>A reaction has now commenced; good, in so far as it reveals a desire for and promise of new life; evil, in so far as it</p>
     <p>betrays narrow views, a tendency to injustice towards departed genius, and the absence of any fixed rule or principle</p>
     <p>to guide our appreciation of the past. Human judgment, like Luther’s drunken peasant, when saved from falling on</p>
     <p>one side, too often topples over on the other. The reaction against Goethe, in his own country especially, which was</p>
     <p>courageously and justly begun by Menzel during his lifetime, has been carried to exaggeration since his death. Certain</p>
     <p>social opinions, to which I myself belong, but which, although founded on a sacred principle, should not be allowed to</p>
     <p>interfere with the impartiality of our judgment, have weighed heavily in the balance; and many young, ardent, and</p>
     <p>enthusiastic minds of our day have reiterated with Bönne that Goethe is the worst of despots; the cancer of the</p>
     <p>German body.</p>
     <p>The English reaction against Byron—I do not speak of that mixture of cant and stupidity which denies the poet his</p>
     <p>place in Westminster Abbey, but of literary reaction—has shown itself still more unreasoning. I have met with adorers</p>
     <p>of Shelley who denied the poetic genius of Byron; others who seriously compared his poems with those of Sir Walter</p>
     <p>Scott. One very much overrated critic writes that “Byron makes man after his own image, and woman after his own</p>
     <p>heart; the one is a capricious tyrant, the other a yielding slave.” The first forgot the verses in which their favorite“The pilgrim of eternity, whose fame</p>
     <p>Over his living head like Heaven is bent; 1</p>
     <p>the second, that after the appearance of “The Giaour” and “Childe Harold,” Sir Walter Scott renounced writing</p>
     <p>poetry. 2 The last forgot that while he was quietly writing criticisms, Byron was dying for new-born liberty in Greece.</p>
     <p>All judged, too many in each country still judge, the two poets, Byron and Goethe, after an absolute type of the</p>
     <p>beautiful, the true, or the false, which they had formed in their own minds; without regard to the state of social</p>
     <p>relations as they were or are; without any true conception of the destiny or mission of poetry, or of the law by which</p>
     <p>it, and every other artistic manifestation of human life, is governed.</p>
     <p>There is no absolute type on earth: the absolute exists in the Divine Idea alone; the gradual comprehension of which</p>
     <p>man is destined to attain; although its complete realization is impossible on earth; earthly life being but one stage of</p>
     <p>the eternal evolution of life, manifested in thought and action; strengthened by all the achievements of the past, and</p>
     <p>advancing from age to ages towards a less imperfect expression of that idea. Our earthly life is one phase of the</p>
     <p>eternal aspiration of the soul towards progress, which is our law; ascending in increasing power and purity from the</p>
     <p>finite towards the infinite; from the real towards the ideal; from that which is, towards that which is to come. In the</p>
     <p>immense storehouse of the past evolutions of life constituted by universal tradition, and in the prophetic instinct</p>
     <p>brooding in the depths of the human soul, does poetry seek inspiration. It changes with the times, for it is their</p>
     <p>expression; it is transformed with society, for—consciously or unconsciously—it sings the lay of Humanity; although,</p>
     <p>according to the individual bias or circumstances of the singer, it assumes the hues of the present, or of the future in</p>
     <p>course of elaboration, and foreseen by the inspiration of genius. It sings now a dirge and now a cradle song; it</p>
     <p>initiates or sums up.</p>
     <p>Byron and Goethe summed up. Was it a defect in them? No; it was the law of the times, and yet society at the</p>
     <p>present day, twenty years after they have ceased to sing, assumes to condemn them for having been born too soon.</p>
     <p>Happy indeed are the poets whom God raises up at the commencement of an era, under the rays of the rising sun. A</p>
     <p>series of generations will lovingly repeat their verses, and attribute to them the new life which they did but foresee</p>
     <p>in the germ.</p>
     <p>Byron and Goethe summed up. This is at once the philosophical explanation of their works, and the secret of their</p>
     <p>popularity. The spirit of an entire epoch of the European world became incarnate in them ere its decease, even as—in</p>
     <p>the political sphere—the spirit of Greece and Rome became incarnate before death in Cæsar and Alexander. They</p>
     <p>were the poetic expression of that principle, of which England was the economic, France the political, and Germany</p>
     <p>the philosophic expression: the last formula, effort, and result of a society founded on the principle of individuality.</p>
     <p>That epoch, the mission of which had been, first through the labors of Greek philosophy, and afterwards through</p>
     <p>Christianity, to rehabilitate, emancipate, and develop individual man appears to have concentrated in them, in</p>
     <p>Fichte, in Adam Smith, and in the French school des droits de l’homme, its whole energy and power, in order fully to</p>
     <p>represent and express all that it had achieved for mankind. It was much; but it was not the whole; and therefore it</p>
     <p>was doomed to pass away. The epoch of individuality was deemed near the goal; when lo! immense horizons were</p>
     <p>revealed; vast unknown lands in whose untrodden forests the principle of individuality was an insufficient guide. By</p>
     <p>the long and painful labors of that epoch the human unknown quantity had been disengaged from the various</p>
     <p>quantities of different nature by which it had been surrounded; but only to be left weak, isolated, and recoiling in</p>
     <p>terror from the solitude in which it stood. The political schools of the epoch had proclaimed the sole basis of civil</p>
     <p>organization to be the right to liberty and equality (liberty for all), but they had encountered social anarchy by the</p>
     <p>way. The philosophy of the epoch had asserted the sovereignty of the human Ego, and had ended in the mere</p>
     <p>adoration of fact, in Hegelian immobility. The Economy of the epoch imagined it had organized free competition,</p>
     <p>while it had but organized the oppression of the weak by the strong; of labor by capital; of poverty by wealth. The</p>
     <p>Poetry of the epoch had represented individuality in its every phase; had translated in sentiment what science had</p>
     <p>theoretically demonstrated; and it had encountered the void. But as society at last discovered that the destinies of</p>
     <p>the race were not contained in a mere problem of liberty, but rather in the harmonization of liberty with association</p>
     <p>—so did poetry discover that the life it had hitherto drawn from individuality alone was doomed to perish for want of</p>
     <p>aliment; and that its future existence depended on enlarging and transforming its sphere. Both society and poetry</p>
     <p>uttered a cry of despair: the death-agony of a form of society produced the agitation we have seen constantly</p>
     <p>increasing in Europe since 1815: the death-agony of a form of poetry evoked Byron and Goethe. I believe this point of</p>
     <p>view to be the only one that can lead us to a useful and impartial appreciation of these two great spirits.</p>
     <p>There are two forms of individuality; the expressions of its internal and external, or—as the Germans would say—of its</p>
     <p>subjective and objective life. Byron was the poet of the first, Goethe of the last. In Byron the Ego is revealed in all its</p>
     <p>pride of power, freedom, and desire, in the uncontrolled plenitude of all its faculties; inhaling existence at every</p>
     <p>pore, eager to seize “the life of life.” The world around him neither rules nor tempers him. The Byronian Ego aspires</p>
     <p>to rule it; but solely for dominion’s sake, to exercise upon it the Titanic force of his will. Accurately speaking, he</p>
     <p>cannot be said to derive from it either color, tone, or image; for it is he who colors; he who sings; he whose image is</p>
     <p>everywhere reflected and reproduced. His poetry emanates from his own soul; to be thence diffused upon things</p>
     <p>external; he holds his state in the centre of the universe, and from thence projects the light radiating from the</p>
     <p>depths of his own mind; as scorching and intense as the concentrated solar ray. Hence that terrible unity which only</p>
     <p>the superficial reader could mistake for monotony.</p>
     <p>Byron appears at the close of one epoch, and before the dawn of the other; in the midst of a community based upon</p>
     <p>an aristocracy which has outlived the vigor of its prime; surrounded by a Europe containing nothing grand, unless it be</p>
     <p>Napoleon on one side and Pitt on the other, genius degraded to minister to egotism; intellect bound to the service of</p>
     <p>the past. No seer exists to foretell the future: belief is extinct; there is only its pretence: prayer is no more; there is</p>
     <p>only a movement of the lips at a fixed day or hour, for the sake of the family, or what is called the people; love is no</p>
     <p>more; desire has taken its place; the holy warfare of ideas is abandoned; the conflict is that of interests. The worship</p>
     <p>of great thoughts has passed away. That which is, raises the tattered banner of some corpse-like traditions; that</p>
     <p>which would be, hoists only the standard of physical wants, of material appetites: around him are ruins, beyond him</p>
     <p>the desert; the horizon is a blank. A long cry of suffering and indignation bursts from the heart of Byron: he is</p>
     <p>answered by anathemas. He departs; he hurries through Europe in search of an ideal to adore; he traverses it</p>
     <p>distracted, palpitating, like Mazeppa on the wild horse; borne onwards by a fierce desire; the wolves of envy and</p>
     <p>calumny follow in pursuit. He visits Greece; he visits Italy; if anywhere a lingering spark of the sacred fire, a ray of</p>
     <p>divine poetry, is preserved, it must be there. Nothing. A glorious past, a degraded present; none of life’s poetry; no</p>
     <p>movement, save that of the sufferer turning on his couch to relieve his pain. Byron, from the solitude of his exile,</p>
     <p>turns his eyes again towards England; he sings. What does he sing? What springs from the mysterious and unique</p>
     <p>conception which rules, one would say in spite of himself, over all that escapes him in his sleepless vigil? The funeral</p>
     <p>hymn, the death-song, the epitaph of the aristocratic idea; we discovered it, we Continentalists; not his own</p>
     <p>countrymen. He takes his types from amongst those privileged by strength, beauty, and individual power. They are</p>
     <p>grand, poetical, heroic, but solitary; they hold no communion with the world around them, unless it be to rule over</p>
     <p>it; they defy alike the good and evil principle; they “will bend to neither.” In life and in death “they stand upon their</p>
     <p>strength”; they resist every power, for their own is all their own; it was purchased by</p>
     <p>“Superior science—penance—daring—</p>
     <p>And length of watching—strength of mind—and skill</p>
     <p>In knowledge of our fathers.”</p>
     <p>Each of them is the personification, slightly modified, of a single type, a single idea—the individual; free, but nothing</p>
     <p>more than free; such as the epoch now closing has made him; Faust, but without the compact which submits him to</p>
     <p>the enemy; for the heroes of Byron make no such compact. Cain kneels not to Arimanes; and Manfred, about to die,</p>
     <p>exclaims:</p>
     <p>“The mind, which is immortal, makes itself</p>
     <p>Requital for its good and evil thoughts—</p>
     <p>Is its own origin of ill, and end—</p>
     <p>And its own place and time, its innate sense,</p>
     <p>When stripped of this mortality, derives</p>
     <p>No color from the fleeting things without,</p>
     <p>But is absorbed in sufferance or in joy;</p>
     <p>Born from the knowledge of its own desert.”</p>
     <p>They have no kindred: they live from their own life only; they repulse humanity, and regard the crowd with disdain.</p>
     <p>Each of them says: “I have faith in myself”; never, “I have faith in ourselves.” They all aspire to power or to</p>
     <p>happiness. The one and the other alike escape them; for they bear within them, untold, unacknowledged even to</p>
     <p>themselves, the presentiment of a life that mere liberty can never give them. Free they are; iron souls in iron frames,</p>
     <p>they climb the Alps of the physical world as well as the Alps of thought; still is their visage stamped with a gloomy</p>
     <p>and ineffaceable sadness; still is their soul—whether, as in Cain and Manfred, it plunge into the abyss of the infinite,</p>
     <p>“intoxicated with eternity,” or scour the vast plain and boundless ocean with the Corsair and Giaour—haunted by a</p>
     <p>secret and sleepless dread. It seems as if they were doomed to drag the broken links of the chain they have burst</p>
     <p>asunder, riveted to their feet. Not only in the petty society against which they rebel does their soul feel fettered and</p>
     <p>restrained; but even in the world of the spirit. Neither is it to the enmity of society that they succumb; but under the</p>
     <p>assaults of this nameless anguish; under the corroding action of potent faculties “inferior still to their desires and</p>
     <p>their conceptions”; under the deception that comes from within. What can they do with the liberty so painfully won?</p>
     <p>On whom, on what, expend the exuberant vitality within them? They are alone; this is the secret of their</p>
     <p>wretchedness and impotence. They “thirst for good”—Cain has said it for them all—but cannot achieve it; for they</p>
     <p>have no mission, no belief, no comprehension even of the world around them. They have never realized the</p>
     <p>conception of Humanity in the multitudes that have preceded, surround, and will follow after them; never thought on</p>
     <p>their own place between the past and future; on the continuity of labor that unites all the generations into one</p>
     <p>whole; on the common end and aim, only to be realized by the common effort; on the spiritual post-sepulchral life</p>
     <p>even on earth of the individual, through the thoughts he transmits to his fellows; and, it may be—when he lives</p>
     <p>devoted and dies in faith—through the guardian agency he is allowed to exercise over the loved ones left on earth.</p>
     <p>Gifted with a liberty they know not how to use; with a power and energy they know not how to apply; with a life</p>
     <p>whose purpose and aim they comprehend not; they drag through their useless and convulsed existence. Byron</p>
     <p>destroys them one after the other, as if he were the executioner of a sentence decreed in heaven. They fall unwept,</p>
     <p>like a withered leaf into the stream of time.</p>
     <p>“Nor earth nor sky shall yield a single tear,</p>
     <p>Nor cloud shall gather more, nor leaf shall fall,</p>
     <p>Nor gale breathe forth one sigh for thee, for all.”</p>
     <p>They die, as they have lived, alone; and a popular malediction hovers round their solitary tombs.</p>
     <p>This, for those who can read with the soul’s eyes, is what Byron sings; or rather what humanity sings through him. The</p>
     <p>emptiness of the life and death of solitary individuality has never been so powerfully and efficaciously summed up as</p>
     <p>in the pages of Byron. The crowd do not comprehend him: they listen; fascinated for an instant; then repent, and</p>
     <p>avenge their momentary transport by calumniating and insulting the poet. His intuition of the death of a form of</p>
     <p>society they call wounded self-love; his sorrow for all is misinterpreted as cowardly egotism. They credit not the</p>
     <p>traces of profound suffering revealed by his lineaments; they credit not the presentiment of a new life which from</p>
     <p>time to time escapes his trembling lips; they believe not in the despairing embrace in which he grasps the material</p>
     <p>universe—stars, lakes, alps, and sea—and identifies himself with it, and through it with God, of whom—to him at least</p>
     <p>—it is a symbol. They do, however, take careful count of some unhappy moments, in which, wearied out by the</p>
     <p>emptiness of life, he has raised—with remorse I am sure—the cup of ignoble pleasures to his lips, believing he might</p>
     <p>find forgetfulness there. How many times have not his accusers drained this cup, without redeeming the sin by a</p>
     <p>single virtue; without—I will not say bearing—but without having even the capacity of appreciating the burden which</p>
     <p>weighed on Byron! And did he not himself dash into fragments the ignoble cup, so soon as he beheld something</p>
     <p>worthy the devotion of his life?</p>
     <p>Goethe—individuality in its objective life—having, like Byron, a sense of the falsehood and evil of the world round him</p>
     <p>—followed exactly the opposite path. After having—he, too, in his youth—uttered a cry of anguish in his Werther;</p>
     <p>after having laid bare the problem of the epoch in all its terrific nudity, in Faust, he thought he had done enough, and</p>
     <p>refused to occupy himself with its solution. It is possible that the impulse of rebellion against social wrong and evil</p>
     <p>which burst forth for an instant in Werther may long have held his soul in secret travail; but that he despaired of the</p>
     <p>task of reforming it as beyond his powers. He himself remarked in his later years, when commenting on the</p>
     <p>exclamation made by a Frenchman on first seeing him: “That is the face of a man who has suffered much”; that he</p>
     <p>should rather have said: That is the face of a man who has struggled energetically;” but of this there remains no</p>
     <p>trace in his works. Whilst Byron writhed and suffered under the sense of the wrong and evil around him, he attained</p>
     <p>the calm—I cannot say of victory—but of indifference. In Byron the man always ruled, and even at times, overcame</p>
     <p>the artist: the man was completely lost in the artist in Goethe. In him there was no subjective life; no unity springing</p>
     <p>either from heart or head. Goethe is an intelligence that receives, elaborates, and reproduces the poetry affluent to</p>
     <p>him from all external objects: from all points of the circumference; to him as centre. He dwells aloft alone; a mighty</p>
     <p>watcher in the midst of creation. His curious scrutiny investigates, with equal penetration and equal interest, the</p>
     <p>depths of the ocean and the calyx of the floweret. Whether he studies the rose exhaling its Eastern perfume of the</p>
     <p>sky, or the ocean casting its countless wrecks upon the shore, the brow of the poet remains equally calm: to him they</p>
     <p>are but two forms of the beautiful; two subjects for art.</p>
     <p>Goethe has been called a pantheist. I know not in what sense critics apply this vague and often ill-understood word to</p>
     <p>him. There is a materialistic pantheism and a spiritual pantheism; the pantheism of Spinoza and that of Giordano</p>
     <p>Bruno; of St. Paul; and of many others—all different. But there is no poetic pantheism possible, save on the condition</p>
     <p>of embracing the whole world of phenomena in one unique conception: of feeling and comprehending the life of the</p>
     <p>universe in its divine unity. There is nothing of this in Goethe. There is pantheism in some parts of Wordsworth; in the</p>
     <p>third canto of “Childe Harold,” and in much of Shelley; but there is none in the most admirable compositions of</p>
     <p>Goethe; wherein life, though admirably comprehended and reproduced in each of its successive manifestations, is</p>
     <p>never understood as a whole. Goethe is the poet of details, not of unity; of analysis, not of synthesis. None so able to</p>
     <p>investigate details; to set off and embellish minute and apparently trifling points; none throw so beautiful a light on</p>
     <p>separate parts; but the connecting link escapes him. His works resemble a magnificent encyclopædia, unclassified.</p>
     <p>He has felt everything but he has never felt the whole. Happy in detecting a ray of the beautiful upon the humblest</p>
     <p>blade of grass gemmed with dew; happy in seizing the poetic elements of an incident the most prosaic in appearance</p>
     <p>—he was incapable of tracing all to a common source, and recomposing the grand ascending scale in which, to quote a</p>
     <p>beautiful expression of Herder’s “every creature is a numerator of the grand denominator, Nature.” How, indeed,</p>
     <p>should he comprehend these things, he who had no place in his works or in his poet’s heart for humanity, by the light</p>
     <p>of which conception only can the true worth of sublunary things be determined? “Religion and politics,” 3 said he,</p>
     <p>“are a troubled element for art. I have always kept myself aloof from them as much as possible.” Questions of life</p>
     <p>and death for the millions were agitated around him; Germany re-echoed to the war songs of K&amp;oml;rner; Fichte, at</p>
     <p>the close of one of his lectures, seized his musket, and joined the volunteers who were hastening (alas! what have</p>
     <p>not the Kings made of that magnificent outburst of nationality!) to fight the battles of their fatherland. The ancient</p>
     <p>soil of Germany thrilled beneath their tread; he, an artist, looked on unmoved; his heart knew no responsive throb to</p>
     <p>the emotion that shook his country; his genius, utterly passive, drew apart from the current that swept away entire</p>
     <p>races. He witnessed the French Revolution in all its terrible grandeur, and saw the old world crumble beneath its</p>
     <p>strokes; and while all the best and purest spirits of Germany, who had mistaken the death-agony of the old world for</p>
     <p>the birth-throes of a new, were wringing their hands at the spectacle of dissolution, he saw in it only the subject of a</p>
     <p>farce. He beheld the glory and the fall of Napoleon; he witnessed the reaction of down-trodden nationalities—sublime</p>
     <p>prologue of the grand epopee of the peoples destined sooner or later to be unfolded—and remained a cold spectator.</p>
     <p>He had neither learned to esteem men, to better them, nor even to suffer with them. If we except the beautiful type</p>
     <p>of Berlichingen, a poetic inspiration of his youth, man, as the creature of thought and action; the artificer of the</p>
     <p>future, so nobly sketched by Schiller in his dramas, has no representative in his works. He has carried something of</p>
     <p>this nonchalance even into the manner in which his heroes conceive love. Goethe’s altar is spread with the choicest</p>
     <p>flowers, the most exquisite perfumes, the first-fruits of nature; but the Priest is wanting. In his work of second</p>
     <p>creation—for it cannot be denied that such it was—he has gone through the vast circle of living and visible things; but</p>
     <p>stopped short before the seventh day. God withdrew from him before that time; and the creatures the poet has</p>
     <p>evoked wander within the circle, dumb and prayerless; awaiting until the man shall come to give them a name, and</p>
     <p>appoint them to a destination.</p>
     <p>No, Goethe is not the poet of Pantheism; he is a polytheist in his method as an artist; the pagan poet of modern</p>
     <p>times. His world is, above all things, the world of forms: a multiplied Olympus. The Mosaic heaven and the Christian</p>
     <p>are veiled to him. Like the pagans, he parcels out Nature into fragments, and makes of each a divinity; like them, he</p>
     <p>worships the sensuous rather than the ideal; he looks, touches, and listens far more than he feels. And what care and</p>
     <p>labor are bestowed upon the plastic portion of his art! what importance is given—I will not say to the objects</p>
     <p>themselves—but to the external representation of objects! Has he not somewhere said that “the beautiful is the</p>
     <p>result of happy position?”4</p>
     <p>Under this definition is concealed an entire system of poetic materialism, substituted for the worship of the ideal;</p>
     <p>involving a whole series of consequences, the logical result of which was to lead Goethe to indifference, that moral</p>
     <p>suicide of some of the noblest energies of genius. The absolute concentration of every faculty of observation on each</p>
     <p>of the objects to be represented, without relation to the ensemble; the entire avoidance of every influence likely to</p>
     <p>modify the view taken of that object, became in his hands one of the most effective means of art. The poet, in his</p>
     <p>eyes, was neither the rushing stream a hundred times broken on its course, that it may carry fertility to the</p>
     <p>surrounding country; nor the brilliant flame, consuming itself in the light it sheds around while ascending to heaven;</p>
     <p>but rather the placid lake, reflecting alike the tranquil landscape and the thunder-cloud; its own surface the while</p>
     <p>unruffled even by the lightest breeze. A serene and passive calm with the absolute clearness and distinctness of</p>
     <p>successive impressions, in each of which he was for the time wholly absorbed, are the peculiar characteristics of</p>
     <p>Goethe. “I allow the objects I desire to comprehend, to act tranquilly upon me,” said he; “I then observe the</p>
     <p>impression I have received from them, and I endeavor to render it faithfully.” Goethe has here portrayed his every</p>
     <p>feature to perfection. He was in life such as Madame Von Arnim proposed to represent him after death; a venerable</p>
     <p>old man, with a serene, almost radiant countenance; clothed in an antique robe, holding a lyre resting on his knees,</p>
     <p>and listening to the harmonies drawn from it either by the hand of a genius, or the breath of the winds. The last</p>
     <p>chords wafted his soul to the East; to the land of inactive contemplation. It was time: Europe had become too</p>
     <p>agitated for him.</p>
     <p>Such were Byron and Goethe in their general characteristics; both great poets; very different, and yet, complete as is</p>
     <p>the contrast between them, and widely apart as are the paths they pursue, arriving at the same point. Life and</p>
     <p>death, character and poetry, everything is unlike in the two, and yet the one is the complement of the other. Both</p>
     <p>are the children of fatality—for it is especially at the close of epochs that the providential law which directs the</p>
     <p>generations assumes towards individuals the semblance of fatality—and compelled by it unconsciously to work out a</p>
     <p>great mission. Goethe contemplates the world in parts, and delivers the impressions they make upon him, one by</p>
     <p>one, as occasion presents them. Byron looks upon the world from a single comprehensive point of view; from the</p>
     <p>height of which he modifies in his own soul the impressions produced by external objects, as they pass before him.</p>
     <p>Goethe successively absorbs his own individuality in each of the objects he reproduces. Byron stamps every object he</p>
     <p>portrays with his own individuality. To Goethe, nature is the symphony; to Byron it is the prelude. She furnishes to the</p>
     <p>one the entire subject; to the other the occasion only of his verse. The one executes her harmonies; the other</p>
     <p>composes on the theme she has suggested. Goethe better expresses lives; Byron life. The one is more vast; the other</p>
     <p>more deep. The first searches everywhere for the beautiful, and loves, above all things, harmony and repose; the</p>
     <p>other seeks the sublime, and adores action and force. Characters, such as Coriolanus or Luther, disturbed Goethe. I</p>
     <p>know not if, in his numerous pieces of criticism, he has ever spoken of Dante; but assuredly he must have shared the</p>
     <p>antipathy felt for him by Sir Walter Scott; and although he would undoubtedly have sufficiently respected his genius</p>
     <p>to admit him into his Pantheon, yet he would certainly have drawn a veil between his mental eye and the grand but</p>
     <p>sombre figure of the exiled seer, who dreamed of the future empire of the world for his country, and of the world’s</p>
     <p>harmonious development under her guidance. Byron loved and drew inspiration from Dante. He also loved Washington</p>
     <p>and Franklin, and followed, with all the sympathies of a soul athirst for action, the meteor-like career of the greatest</p>
     <p>genius of action our age has produced, Napoleon; feeling indignant—perhaps mistakenly—that he did not die in the</p>
     <p>struggle.</p>
     <p>When travelling in that second fatherland of all poetic souls—Italy—the poets still pursued divergent routes; the one</p>
     <p>experienced sensations; the other emotions; the one occupied himself especially with nature; the other with the</p>
     <p>greatness dead, the living wrongs, the human memories. 5</p>
     <p>And yet, notwithstanding all the contrast, which I have only hinted at, but which might be far more elaborately</p>
     <p>displayed by extracts from their works; they arrived—Goethe, the poet of individuality in its objective life—at the</p>
     <p>egotism of indifference; Byron—the poet of individuality in its subjective life—at the egotism (I say it with regret, but</p>
     <p>it, too, it egotism) of despair: a double sentence upon the epoch which it was their mission to represent and to close!</p>
     <p>Both of them—I am not speaking of their purely literary merits, incontestable and universally acknowledged—the one</p>
     <p>by the spirit of resistance that breathes through all his creations; the other by the spirit of sceptical irony that</p>
     <p>pervades his works, and by the independent sovereignty attributed to art over all social relations—greatly aided the</p>
     <p>cause of intellectual emancipation, and awakened in men’s minds the sentiment of liberty. Both of them—the one,</p>
     <p>directly, by the implacable war he waged against the vices and absurdities of the privileged classes, and indirectly, by</p>
     <p>investing his heroes with all the most brilliant qualities of the despot, and then dashing them to pieces as if in anger;</p>
     <p>—the other, by the poetic rehabilitation of forms the most modest, and objects the most insignificant, as well as by</p>
     <p>the importance attributed to details—combated aristocratic prejudices, and developed in men’s minds the sentiment</p>
     <p>of equality. And having by their artistic excellence exhausted both forms of the poetry of individuality, they have</p>
     <p>completed the cycle of its poets; thereby reducing all followers in the same sphere to the subaltern position of</p>
     <p>imitators, and creating the necessity of a new order of poetry; teaching us to recognize a want where before we felt</p>
     <p>only a desire. Together they have laid an era in the tomb; covering it with a pall that none may lift; and, as if to</p>
     <p>proclaim its death to the young generation, the poetry of Goethe has written its history, while that of Byron has</p>
     <p>graven its epitaph.</p>
     <p>And now farewell to Goethe; farewell to Byron! farewell to the sorrows that crush but sanctify not—to the poetic</p>
     <p>flame that illumines but warms not—to the ironical philosophy that dissects without reconstructing—to all poetry</p>
     <p>which, in an age where there is so much to do, teaches us inactive contemplation; or which, in a world where there is</p>
     <p>so much need of devotedness, would instill despair. Farewell to all types of power without an aim; to all</p>
     <p>personifications of the solitary individuality which seeks an aim to find it not, and knows not how to apply the life</p>
     <p>stirring within it; to all egotistic joys and griefs:</p>
     <p>“Bastards of the soul;</p>
     <p>O’erweening slips of idleness: weeds—no more—</p>
     <p>Self-springing here and there from the rank soil;</p>
     <p>O’erflowings of the lust of that same mind</p>
     <p>Whose proper issue and determinate end,</p>
     <p>When wedded to the love of things divine,</p>
     <p>Is peace, complacency, and happiness.”</p>
     <p>When at last he came to a recollection of himself and his position, it was with</p>
     <p>a hope for the world (stanza 98) and a pardon for his enemies. From the fourth</p>
     <p>canto of Childe Harold, the daughter of Byron might learn more of the true spirit</p>
     <p>of her father than from all the reports she may have heard, and all the many</p>
     <p>volumes that have been written upon him.</p>
     <p>Farewell, a long farewell to the past! The dawn of the future is announced to such as can read its signs, and we owe</p>
     <p>ourselves wholly to it.</p>
     <p>The duality of the Middle Ages, after having struggled for centuries under the banners of emperor and pope; after</p>
     <p>having left its trace and borne its fruit in every branch of intellectual development; has reascended to heaven—its</p>
     <p>mission accomplished—in the twin flames of poesy called Goethe and Byron. Two hitherto distinct formulæ of life</p>
     <p>became incarnate in these two men. Byron is isolated man, representing only the internal aspect of life; Goethe</p>
     <p>isolated man, representing only the external.</p>
     <p>Higher than these two incomplete existences; at the point of intersection between the two aspirations towards a</p>
     <p>heaven they were unable to reach, will be revealed the poetry of the future; of humanity; potent in new harmony,</p>
     <p>unity, and life.</p>
     <p>But because, in our own day, we are beginning, though vaguely, to foresee this new social poetry, which will soothe</p>
     <p>the suffering soul by teaching it to rise towards God through humanity; because we now stand on the threshold of a</p>
     <p>new epoch, which, but for them, we should not have reached; shall we decry those who were unable to do more for</p>
     <p>us than cast their giant forms into the gulf that held us all doubting and dismayed on the other side? From the earliest</p>
     <p>times has genius been made the scapegoat of the generations. Society has never lacked men who have contented</p>
     <p>themselves with reproaching the Chattertons of their day with not being patterns of self-devotion, instead of physical</p>
     <p>or moral suicides; without ever asking themselves whether they had, during their lifetime, endeavored to place aught</p>
     <p>within the reach of such but doubt and destitution. I feel the necessity of protesting earnestly against the reaction</p>
     <p>set on foot by certain thinkers against the mighty-souled, which serves as a cloak for the cavilling spirit of mediocrity.</p>
     <p>There is something hard, repulsive, and ungrateful in the destructive instinct which so often forgets what has been</p>
     <p>done by the great men who preceded us, to demand of them merely an account of what more might have been done.</p>
     <p>Is the pillow of scepticism so soft to genius as to justify the conclusion that it is from egotism only that at times it</p>
     <p>rests its fevered brow thereon? Are we so free from the evil reflected in their verse as to have a right to condemn</p>
     <p>their memory? That evil was not introduced into the world by them. They saw it, felt it, respired it; it was around,</p>
     <p>about, on every side of them, and they were its greatest victims. How could they avoid reproducing it in their works?</p>
     <p>It is not by deposing Goethe or Byron that we shall destroy either sceptical or anarchical indifference amongst us. It is</p>
     <p>by becoming believers and organizers ourselves. If we are such, we need fear nothing. As is the public, so will be the</p>
     <p>poet. If we revere enthusiasm, the fatherland, and humanity; if our hearts are pure, and our souls steadfast and</p>
     <p>patient, the genius inspired to interpret our aspirations, and bear to heaven our ideas and our sufferings, will not be</p>
     <p>wanting. Let these statues stand. The noble monuments of feudal times create no desire to return to the days of</p>
     <p>serfdom.</p>
     <p>But I shall be told, there are imitators. I know it too well; but what lasting influence can be exerted on social life by</p>
     <p>those who have no real life of their own? They will but flutter in the void, so long as void there be. On the day when</p>
     <p>the living shall arise to take the place of the dead, they will vanish like ghosts at cock-crow. Shall we never be</p>
     <p>sufficiently firm in our own faith to dare to show fitting reverence for the grand typical figures of an anterior age? It</p>
     <p>would be idle to speak of social art at all, or of the comprehension of humanity, if we could not raise altars to the</p>
     <p>new gods, without overthrowing the old. Those only should dare to utter the sacred name of progress, whose souls</p>
     <p>possess intelligence enough to comprehend the past, and whose hearts possess sufficient poetic religion to reverence</p>
     <p>its greatness. The temple of the true believer is not the chapel of a sect; it is a vast Pantheon, in which the glorious</p>
     <p>images of Goethe and Byron will hold their honored place, long after Goetheism and Byronism shall have ceased to</p>
     <p>be.</p>
     <p>When, purified alike from imitation and distrust, men learn to pay righteous reverence to the mighty fallen, I know</p>
     <p>not whether Goethe will obtain more of their admiration as an artist, but I am certain that Byron will inspire them</p>
     <p>with more love, both as man and poet—a love increased even by the fact of the great injustice hitherto shown to him.</p>
     <p>While Goethe held himself all of from us, and from the height of his Olympian calm seemed to smile with disdain at</p>
     <p>our desires, our struggles, and our sufferings—Byron wandered through the world, sad, gloomy, and unquiet;</p>
     <p>wounded, and bearing the arrow in the wound. Solitary and unfortunate in his infancy; unfortunate in his first love,</p>
     <p>and still more terribly so in his ill-advised marriage; attacked and calumniated both in his acts and intentions without</p>
     <p>inquiry or defence; harassed by pecuniary difficulties; forced to quit his country, home, and child; friendless—we have</p>
     <p>seen it too clearly since his death—pursued even on the Continent by a thousand absurd and infamous falsehoods, and</p>
     <p>by the old malignity of a world that twisted even his sorrows into a crime; he yet, in the midst of inevitable reaction,</p>
     <p>preserved his love for his sister and his Ada; his compassion for misfortune; his fidelity to the affections of his</p>
     <p>childhood and youth, from Lord Clare to his old servant Murray, and his nurse Mary Gray. He was generous with his</p>
     <p>money to all whom he could help or serve, from his literary friends down to the wretched libeller Ashe. Though</p>
     <p>impelled by the temper of his genius, by the period in which he lived, and by that fatality of his mission to which I</p>
     <p>have alluded, towards a poetic individualism, the inevitable incompleteness of which I have endeavored to explain,</p>
     <p>he by no means set it up as a standard. That he presaged the future with the provision of genius is proved by his</p>
     <p>definition of poetry in his journal—a definition hitherto misunderstood, but yet the best I know: “Poetry is the feeling</p>
     <p>of a former world and of a future.” Poet as he was, he preferred activity for good, to all that his art could do.</p>
     <p>Surrounded by slaves and their oppressors; a traveller in countries where even remembrance seemed extinct; never</p>
     <p>did he desert the cause of the peoples; never was he false to human sympathies. A witness of the progress of the</p>
     <p>Restoration, and the triumph of the principles of the Holy Alliance, he never swerved from his courageous opposition;</p>
     <p>he preserved and publicly proclaimed his faith in the rights of the peoples and in the final 6 triumph of liberty. The</p>
     <p>following passage from his journal is the very abstract of the law governing the efforts of the true party of progress at</p>
     <p>the present day: “Onwards! it is now the time to act; and what signifies self, if a single spark of that which would be</p>
     <p>worthy of the past 7 can be bequeathed unquenchably to the future? It is not one man, nor a million, but the spirit of</p>
     <p>liberty which must be spread. The waves which dash on the shore are, one by one, broken; but yet the ocean</p>
     <p>conquers nevertheless. It overwhelms the armada; it wears the rock; and if the Neptunians are to be believed, it has</p>
     <p>not only destroyed but made a world.” At Naples, in the Romagna, wherever he saw a spark of noble life stirring, he</p>
     <p>was ready for any exertion; or danger, to blow it into a flame. He stigmatized baseness, hypocrisy, and injustice,</p>
     <p>whencesoever they sprang.</p>
     <p>Thus lived Byron, ceaselessly tempest-tossed between the ills of the present and his yearnings after the future; often</p>
     <p>unequal; sometimes sceptical; but always suffering—often most so when he seemed to laugh; 8 and always loving,</p>
     <p>even when he seemed to curse.</p>
     <p>Never did “the eternal spirit of the chainless mind” make a brighter apparition amongst us. He seems at times a</p>
     <p>transformation of that immortal Prometheus, of whom he has written so nobly; whose cry of agony, yet of futurity,</p>
     <p>sounded above the cradle of the European world; and whose grand and mysterious form, transfigured by time,</p>
     <p>reappears from age to age, between the entombment of one epoch and the accession of another; to wail forth the</p>
     <p>lament of genius, tortured by the presentment of things it will not see realized in its time. Byron, too, had the “firm</p>
     <p>will” and the “deep sense”; he, too, made of his “death a victory.” When he heard the cry of nationality and liberty</p>
     <p>burst forth in the land he had loved and sung in early youth, he broke his harp and set forth. While the Christian</p>
     <p>Powers were protocolizing or worse—while the Christian nations were doling forth the alms of a few piles of ball in aid</p>
     <p>of the Cross struggling with the Crescent; he, the poet, and pretended sceptic, hastened to throw his fortune, his</p>
     <p>genius, and his life at the feet of the first people that had arisen in the name of the nationality and liberty he loved.</p>
     <p>I know no more beautiful symbol of the future destiny and mission of art than the death of Byron in Greece. The holy</p>
     <p>alliance of poetry with the cause of the peoples; the union—still so rare—of thought and action—which alone</p>
     <p>completes the human Word, and is destined to emancipate the world; the grand solidarity of all nations in the</p>
     <p>conquest of the rights ordained by God for all his children, and in the accomplishment of that mission for which alone</p>
     <p>such rights exist—all that is now the religion and the hope of the party of progress throughout Europe, is gloriously</p>
     <p>typified in this image, which we, barbarians that we are, have already forgotten.</p>
     <p>The day will come when democracy will remember all that it owes to Byron. England, too, will, I hope, one day</p>
     <p>remember the mission—so entirely English, yet hitherto overlooked by her—which Byron fulfilled on the Continent;</p>
     <p>the European rôle given by him to English literature, and the appreciation and sympathy for England which he</p>
     <p>awakened amongst us.</p>
     <p>Before he came, all that was known of English literature was the French translation of Shakespeare, and the</p>
     <p>anathema hurled by Voltaire against the “intoxicated barbarian.” It is since Byron that we Continentalists have</p>
     <p>learned to study Shakespeare and other English writers. From him dates the sympathy of all the true-hearted amongst</p>
     <p>us for this land of liberty, whose true vocation he so worthily represented among the oppressed. He led the genius of</p>
     <p>Britain on a pilgrimage throughout all Europe.</p>
     <p>England will one day feel how ill it is—not for Byron but for herself—that the foreigner who lands upon her shores</p>
     <p>should search in vain in that temple which should be her national Pantheon, for the poet beloved and admired by all</p>
     <p>the nations of Europe, and for whose death Greece and Italy wept as it had been that of the noblest of their own</p>
     <p>sons.</p>
     <p>In these few pages—unfortunately very hasty—my aim has been, not so much to criticise either Goethe or Byron, for</p>
     <p>which both time and space are wanting, as to suggest, and if possible lead, English criticism upon a broader, more</p>
     <p>impartial, and more useful path than the one generally followed. Certain travellers of the eleventh century relate</p>
     <p>that they saw at Teneriffe a prodigiously lofty tree, which, from its immense extent of foliage, collected all the</p>
     <p>vapors of the atmosphere; to discharge them, when its branches were shaken, in a shower of pure and refreshing</p>
     <p>water. Genius is like this tree, and the mission of criticism should be to shake the branches. At the present day it</p>
     <p>more resembles a savage striving to hew down the noble tree to the roots.</p>
     <p>1. Adonais.</p>
     <p>2. Lockhart.</p>
     <p>3. Goethe and his Contemporaries.</p>
     <p>4. In the Kunst und Alterthum, I think.</p>
     <p>5. The contrast between the two poets in nowhere more strikingly displayed than by the manner in which they were</p>
     <p>affected by the sight of Rome. In Goethe’s Elegies and in his Travels in Italy we find the impressions of the artist only.</p>
     <p>He did not understand Rome. The eternal synthesis that, from the heights of the Capitol and St. Peter, is gradually</p>
     <p>unfolded in ever-widening circles, embracing first a nation and then Europe, as it will ultimately embrace humanity,</p>
     <p>remained unrevealed to him; he saw only the inner circle of paganism; the least prolific, as well as least indigenous.</p>
     <p>One might fancy that he caught a glimpse of it for an instant, when he wrote: “History is read here far otherwise than</p>
     <p>in any other spot in the universe; elsewhere we read it from without to within; here one seems to read it from within</p>
     <p>to without;” but if so, he soon lost sight of it again, and became absorbed in external nature. “Whether we halt or</p>
     <p>advance, we discover a landscape ever renewing itself in a thousand fashions. We have palaces and ruins; gardens and</p>
     <p>solitudes; the horizon lengthens in the distance, or suddenly contracts; huts and stables, columns and triumphal</p>
     <p>arches, all lie pell-mell and often so close that we might find room for all on the same sheet of paper.”</p>
     <p>At Rome Byron forgot passions, sorrows, his own individuality, all, in the presence of a great idea; witness this</p>
     <p>utterance of a soul born for devotedness-</p>
     <p>&quot;O Rome! my country! city of the soul!</p>
     <p>The orphans of the heart must turn to thee,</p>
     <p>Lone mother of dead empires! and control</p>
     <p>In their shut breasts their petty misery.&quot;</p>
     <p>6.&quot;Yet, Freedom! yet, thy banner torn, but flying.</p>
     <p>Streams, like the thunder-storm, against the wind:</p>
     <p>Thy trumpet voice, though broken now and dying.</p>
     <p>The loudest still the tempest leaves behind.</p>
     <p>The tree hath lost its blossoms, and the rind,</p>
     <p>Chopped by the axe, looks rough and little worth.</p>
     <p>But the sap lasts—and still the seed we find</p>
     <p>Sown deep, even in the bosom of the North,</p>
     <p>So shall a better spring less bitter fruit bring forth.&quot;</p>
     <p>7. Written in Italy.</p>
     <p>8. “And if I laugh at any mortal thing.</p>
